2001-04-23  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* mainwin.tcl: changed name of 
	disable_device_widgets_for_commands_suspended to 
	disable_widgets_for_commands_suspended and various other changes to
	bring this file closer to the thirdtech_branch version - this fixes
	a problem with buttons like xy_lock not getting enabled when 
	connecting to a microscope

2001-03-22  Jason Clark  <jclark@cs.unc.edu>

	* import.tcl: Can now load imported objects through OS specific
	file loading interface.

	* setupmenu.tcl: New dynamic loading of viz-textures and switching
	between those textures.

2001-03-13  Jason Clark  <jclark@cs.unc.edu>

	* import.tcl: Made the color selecting a standard option

	* setupmenu.tcl: New interface option to support visualization
	texture scaling.

2001-03-12  Jason Clark  <jclark@cs.unc.edu>

	* mainwin.tcl: Use new import interface

	* import.tcl: New import objects interface that works for any kind
	of recognized file. One portion of the interface is common to all
	files, and another portion is created dynamically depending on the
	file type.  Allowing interfaces specialized to a file type.

2001-03-09  Tom Hudson  <hudson@cs.unc.edu>

	* shared_ptr.tcl (collab_connection_good) : new procedure actually
	enables collaboration once all the connections are made.

2001-03-06  Tom Hudson  <hudson@cs.unc.edu>

	* shared_ptr.tcl:  added a less-error-prone interface to choose
	collaborator by selecting from a list, + option to type in a name.
	After first selection of a collaborator, option to choose again
	is disabled (until we figure out how to change collaborators
	safely).

2001-03-02  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

        * mainwin.tcl: removed an extra call to 
        source [file join ${tcl_script_dir} shared_ptr.tcl] that caused
        nano to crash

2001-03-02  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* litho_main.tcl: added some parameters for the ebeamWriter program

2001-03-02  Aron Helser  <helser@cs.unc.edu>

	* mainwin.tcl: Always source shared_ptr.tcl so mutex messages are
	handled without error. 

2001-02-09  Jason Clark  <jclark@cs.unc.edu>

	* setupmenu.tcl: Added new visualization menu.

2001-02-01  Aron Helser  <helser@cs.unc.edu>

	confirmed whether the code behind it works.

2001-01-14  Jason Clark  <jclark@cs.unc.edu>

	* mainwin.tcl: Added new Shape Analysis menu

	* analysismenu.tcl: Added new Shape Analysis menu

2000-12-28  Aron Helser  <helser@cs.unc.edu>

2000-12-20  Aron Helser  <helser@cs.unc.edu>

	* all: 3rdtech merge into main trunk. 

2000-12-5  Tom Hudson  <hudson@cs.unc.edu>

	* latency.tcl : add forward error correction, queue monitoring,
	network statistics controls to latency pane
	* mainwin.tcl : fixes to cooperation between
	diable_widgets_for_readmode and diable_device_widgets_for_
	commands_suspended.
	* shared_ptr.tcl : fixes to logic in mutex handler callbacks
	so disables and enables are correct

2000-12-05  Kwan Torrich Skinner  <skinner@cs.unc.edu>

	* modify.tcl : new code for optimize now.

2000-11-29  Tom Hudson  <hudson@cs.unc.edu>

	* mainwin.tcl (diable_widgets_for_readmode) : get rid of race
	condition / fighting with diable_device_widgets_for_commands_suspended
	(diable_device_widgets_for_commands_suspended) : clean up and
        add device_ to name to make clearer

	* shared_ptr.tcl (mutex_taken_callback) : make consistent
	with gotRequest/deniedRequest handlers
	(mutex_release_callback) : same

2000-11-29  Tom Hudson  <hudson@cs.unc.edu>

	* mainwin.tcl : add variable collab_commands_suspended and trace
        (disable_widgets_for_commands_suspended) : generalize to also
	support suspending commands when we're collaborating and don't
	have the mutex

	* shared_ptr.tcl (mutex_gotRequest_callback) : clear
	collab_commands_suspended, enable $view.xy_lock
	(mutex_deniedRequest_callback) : set
        collab_commands_suspended, disable $view.xy_lock

	* mainwin.tcl : enclose "source latency.tcl" in test of
        thirdtech_ui instead of commenting it out.

	* latency.tcl : get rid of dependence on $fc and $bc

2000-11-13  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	 explorer1, explorer2 and discoverer

        * modify.tcl : more support for feelahead tool

2000-09-23  Adam Seeger <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* registration.tcl: added a checkbox and variable for letting you 
	resample the "Topography" data (actually this could be from 
	anything image) by warping it into the "Projection" image coordinate
	system (which could also be AFM data or any other image)

2000-09-21  Tom Hudson <hudson@cs.unc.edu>

        * modify.tcl: added feelahead modify tool

2000-09-07  Adam Seeger <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

        the same thing
