	* french_ohmmeter.tcl: tcl_script_dir simplified. 
	* litho_main.tcl: same

	pass. Added plane creation. 

	* mainwin.tcl: tcl_script_dir simplified. 
	frame_rate display added.

2001-05-15  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* litho_main.tcl: added image saving menu item to file menu
	* registration.tcl: unfixed the data-registration-window-closing-nano
	fix from 2001-05-02. This wasn't a fix for the problem; it only disabled
	the registration window from ever being shown and in so doing prevented
	the user from clicking on the close box

2001-05-12  Aron Helser  <helser@cs.unc.edu>

	* filemenu.tcl (save_plane_data): added writing TIFF files. 

	* image.tcl : Label units typo

	NO_PHANTOM, fix menu color

	* setupmenu.tcl: Phase as scan data, local viewer controls

2001-05-11  Aron Helser  <helser@cs.unc.edu>

	* view.tcl: New USER_REGION_MODE button
	* streamfile.tcl: Replay rate type should be numeric, not real. 
	
2001-05-02  Kwan Torrich Skinner  <skinner@cs.unc.edu>
	* registration.tcl: fixed the
	data-registration-window-closing-nano bug.

2001-04-30  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>
	* shared_ptr.tcl: make focus change off of entry box in choose 
	collaborator widget dialog bind
	to <Entry> of button box region in that window

2001-04-30  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>
	* shared_ptr.tcl: temporary comment out of last commit

2001-04-30  Chris Weigle  <weigle@cs.unc.edu>
	* shared_ptr.tcl: make <Enter> in choose collaborator widget bind
	to the conenct button

2001-04-24  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* mainwin.tcl: the last commit (merged stuff from thirdtech_branch
	with this one) worked fine with the pc version of tcl but crashed
	the one on sgi; this puts back those differences 
	(things that are different from whats in the thirdtech_branch) 
	that are necessary for this to work on sgi
	although I have no idea why these things work in one implementation and
	not the other

2001-04-23  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* mainwin.tcl: changed name of 
	disable_device_widgets_for_commands_suspended to 
	disable_widgets_for_commands_suspended and various other changes to
	bring this file closer to the thirdtech_branch version - this fixes
	a problem with buttons like xy_lock not getting enabled when 
	connecting to a microscope

2001-03-22  Jason Clark  <jclark@cs.unc.edu>

	* import.tcl: Can now load imported objects through OS specific
	file loading interface.

	between those textures.

	* import.tcl: Made the color selecting a standard option

	* setupmenu.tcl: New interface option to support visualization
	texture scaling.

2001-03-12  Jason Clark  <jclark@cs.unc.edu>

	* mainwin.tcl: Use new import interface

	* import.tcl: New import objects interface that works for any kind
	of recognized file. One portion of the interface is common to all
	files, and another portion is created dynamically depending on the
	file type.  Allowing interfaces specialized to a file type.

2001-03-09  Tom Hudson  <hudson@cs.unc.edu>

	* shared_ptr.tcl (collab_connection_good) : new procedure actually
	enables collaboration once all the connections are made.

2001-03-06  Tom Hudson  <hudson@cs.unc.edu>

	* shared_ptr.tcl:  added a less-error-prone interface to choose
	collaborator by selecting from a list, + option to type in a name.
	After first selection of a collaborator, option to choose again
	is disabled (until we figure out how to change collaborators
	safely).

2001-03-02  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* mainwin.tcl: removed an extra call to 
	source [file join ${tcl_script_dir} shared_ptr.tcl] that caused
	nano to crash

2001-03-02  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* litho_main.tcl: added some parameters for the ebeamWriter program

2001-03-02  Aron Helser  <helser@cs.unc.edu>

	* mainwin.tcl: Always source shared_ptr.tcl so mutex messages are
	handled without error. 

2001-02-09  Jason Clark  <jclark@cs.unc.edu>

	* setupmenu.tcl: Added new visualization menu.

2001-02-01  Aron Helser  <helser@cs.unc.edu>

	* mainwin.tcl: Add import_objects window back into interface. Not
	confirmed whether the code behind it works.

	* latency.tcl : add forward error correction, queue monitoring,
	network statistics controls to latency pane
	* mainwin.tcl : fixes to cooperation between
	diable_widgets_for_readmode and diable_device_widgets_for_

	* modify.tcl : new code for optimize now.

2000-11-29  Tom Hudson  <hudson@cs.unc.edu>

	* mainwin.tcl (diable_widgets_for_readmode) : get rid of race
	condition / fighting with diable_device_widgets_for_commands_suspended
	(diable_device_widgets_for_commands_suspended) : clean up and
	add device_ to name to make clearer

	* shared_ptr.tcl (mutex_taken_callback) : make consistent
	with gotRequest/deniedRequest handlers
	(mutex_release_callback) : same

2000-11-29  Tom Hudson  <hudson@cs.unc.edu>

	* mainwin.tcl : add variable collab_commands_suspended and trace
	(disable_widgets_for_commands_suspended) : generalize to also
	support suspending commands when we're collaborating and don't
	have the mutex

	* shared_ptr.tcl (mutex_gotRequest_callback) : clear
	collab_commands_suspended, enable $view.xy_lock
	(mutex_deniedRequest_callback) : set
	collab_commands_suspended, disable $view.xy_lock

	* mainwin.tcl : enclose "source latency.tcl" in test of
	thirdtech_ui instead of commenting it out.

	* latency.tcl : get rid of dependence on $fc and $bc

2000-09-23  Adam Seeger <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* registration.tcl: added a checkbox and variable for letting you 
	resample the "Topography" data (actually this could be from 
	anything image) by warping it into the "Projection" image coordinate
	system (which could also be AFM data or any other image)

2000-09-21  Tom Hudson <hudson@cs.unc.edu>

	* modify.tcl: added feelahead modify tool

2000-09-07  Adam Seeger <seeger@cs.unc.edu>
