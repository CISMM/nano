2000-12-20  Aron Helser  <helser@cs.unc.edu>

	* all: 3rdtech merge into main trunk. 

2000-10-11  Chris Weigle  <weigle@cs.unc.edu>

        * Makefile.root_common: fixed OBJECT_DIR line to do right thing
        with (sgi) ABI/ARCH.

2000-10-08  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

        * Merged thirdtech_branch for Makefile.depend to fix
        dependency problems on pc_win32 (uses .obj instead of .o)

2000-09-20  Tom Hudson  <hudson@cs.unc.edu>

	* Added -lglui before -lglut to allow multiScope to compile.
        (Can't use LATE_LIBRARIES because they must come before X11)

2000-09-15  Chris Weigle  <weigle@cs.unc.edu>

        * Makefile.common: removed '-f' from ln options, stops recursion
        * Makefile.app_common: Removed $(OBECT_DIR) target; Split test
        and creation of dirs & symlinks into 3 stages. This did the
        right thing, the one time I tried it, in Russ's environment
        (which didn't do the right thing before).
        * Makefile.lib_common: Same

2000-08-30  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

        * Makefile.depend: if VC is defined then the library search paths for
        things like vrpn, quat, vogl, vrpn_phantom have platform directory
        pc_win32_MTd (Multi-Thread Debug with non DLL runtime library)
        instead of just plain pc_win32
        * Makefile.common: for VC, adds some stuff to SYS_INCLUDE, LOAD_FLAGS
        * Makefile.app-common: for VC, uses VC_LOAD_FLAGS and VC_LIBS

2000-08-11  Kwan Torrich Skinner  <skinner@cs.unc.edu>

	* all: Merge thirdtech_branch code to trunk.
