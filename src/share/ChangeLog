	* Added -lglui before -lglut to allow multiScope to compile.
        (Can't use LATE_LIBRARIES because they must come before X11)

2000-09-15  Chris Weigle  <weigle@cs.unc.edu>
        * Makefile.common: removed '-f' from ln options, stops recursion
        * Makefile.app_common: Removed $(OBECT_DIR) target; Split test
        and creation of dirs & symlinks into 3 stages. This did the
        right thing, the one time I tried it, in Russ's environment
        (which didn't do the right thing before).
        * Makefile.lib_common: Same

2000-08-30  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

        * Makefile.depend: if VC is defined then the library search paths for
        things like vrpn, quat, vogl, vrpn_phantom have platform directory
        pc_win32_MTd (Multi-Thread Debug with non DLL runtime library)
        instead of just plain pc_win32
        * Makefile.common: for VC, adds some stuff to SYS_INCLUDE, LOAD_FLAGS
        * Makefile.app-common: for VC, uses VC_LOAD_FLAGS and VC_LIBS

2000-08-11  Kwan Torrich Skinner  <skinner@cs.unc.edu>

	* all: Merge thirdtech_branch code to trunk.
