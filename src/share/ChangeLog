2001-10-12  Nathan Conrad  <conrad@cs.unc.edu>

	* Makefile.app_common (THIRDTECH): Added a RCFLAGS variable so that
	THIRDTECH can be defined in the nano resource file. This is usefull
	to determine which icon to decorate the binary with.

	* Makefile.common (THIRDTECH):  added a "THIRDTECH variable, which
	is set to 0 for UNC builds, and 1 for 3rd Tech builds. If the
	variable is set to 1, THIRDTECH is added to the list of C defines.

2001-08-20  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* Makefile.common (LOAD_FLAGS): added nodefaultlib:"glut32.lib" because
	for some reason VC++ is trying to link with it even though its not on
	the list of libraries to link with

2001-08-06  David Marshburn  <marshbur@cs.unc.edu>

	* Makefile.common:  (TCL_LIBS) changed SGI-used TCL_LIBS to include
	tcl version number

2001-07-30  David Marshburn  <marshbur@cs.unc.edu>

	* Makefile.common: (TCL_LIBS)  increment tcl, etc. version numbers for
	tcl/tk 8.3.

2001-07-29  David Marshburn  <marshbur@evans.cs.unc.edu>

	* Makefile.common (ARCH_LIBS): set ARCH_LIBS for ImageMagick on SGI

2001-07-27  Aron Helser  <helser@cs.unc.edu>

	* Makefile.common (LOAD_FLAGS): Change ImageMagick libs from debug
	_DB_ to release _RL_

2001-07-26  Aron Helser  <helser@cs.unc.edu>

	* Makefile.common (LOAD_FLAGS): Additions for ImageMagick
	library. Ghost 3.1

2001-05-12  Aron Helser  <helser@cs.unc.edu>

	* Makefile.common : VIEWER changed to NO_MSCOPE_CONNECTION or
	NO_PHANTOM

2001-03-02  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* Makefile.common: added V_GLUT to BAREDEFINES

2001-03-02  Aron Helser  <helser@cs.unc.edu>

	* Makefile.app_common (OBJECT_SUFFIX): New export symbol
	* Makefile.lib_common (OBJECT_SUFFIX): same

2000-12-20  Aron Helser  <helser@cs.unc.edu>

	* all: 3rdtech merge into main trunk. 

2000-10-11  Chris Weigle  <weigle@cs.unc.edu>

        * Makefile.root_common: fixed OBJECT_DIR line to do right thing
        with (sgi) ABI/ARCH.

2000-10-08  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

        * Merged thirdtech_branch for Makefile.depend to fix
        dependency problems on pc_win32 (uses .obj instead of .o)

2000-09-20  Tom Hudson  <hudson@cs.unc.edu>

	* Added -lglui before -lglut to allow multiScope to compile.
        (Can't use LATE_LIBRARIES because they must come before X11)

2000-09-15  Chris Weigle  <weigle@cs.unc.edu>

        * Makefile.common: removed '-f' from ln options, stops recursion
        * Makefile.app_common: Removed $(OBECT_DIR) target; Split test
        and creation of dirs & symlinks into 3 stages. This did the
        right thing, the one time I tried it, in Russ's environment
        (which didn't do the right thing before).
        * Makefile.lib_common: Same

2000-08-30  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

        * Makefile.depend: if VC is defined then the library search paths for
        things like vrpn, quat, vogl, vrpn_phantom have platform directory
        pc_win32_MTd (Multi-Thread Debug with non DLL runtime library)
        instead of just plain pc_win32
        * Makefile.common: for VC, adds some stuff to SYS_INCLUDE, LOAD_FLAGS
        * Makefile.app-common: for VC, uses VC_LOAD_FLAGS and VC_LIBS

2000-08-11  Kwan Torrich Skinner  <skinner@cs.unc.edu>

	* all: Merge thirdtech_branch code to trunk.
