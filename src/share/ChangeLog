        * Makefile.depend: if VC is defined then the library search paths for
        things like vrpn, quat, vogl, vrpn_phantom have platform directory
        pc_win32_MTd (Multi-Thread Debug with non DLL runtime library)
        instead of just plain pc_win32
        * Makefile.common: for VC, adds some stuff to SYS_INCLUDE, LOAD_FLAGS
        * Makefile.app-common: for VC, uses VC_LOAD_FLAGS and VC_LIBS

	* all: Merge thirdtech_branch code to trunk.
