This creates a one-dimensional graph of peaks and valleys that represent
the result of a reaction-diffusion system.

The particular system is one originally described by Alan Turing, and
a clear description of it can be found in:

  How Well Does Turing's Theory of Morphogenesis Work?

  Journal of Theoretical Biology, Vol. 45, No. 2, pp. 501-531.
