        * streamToVrpn.C: made some major changes to this because most of
	the code is now moved into nmm_MicroscopeTranslator.C so it will be
	easier to maintain. This also fixes the bug with the time except
        at the very end of the stream file where system messages screw
        things up again (time goes back to the elapsed time that it took to
        do the translation at the very end of the stream file)
