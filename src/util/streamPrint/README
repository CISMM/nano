Stream Tools


vrpn_headerPrint:
	Takes a nM8.0 stream file, usually with extension .nms, and
	prints out message type, sender, and timestamp. It does not
	print message contents.

vrpn_streamTimeFix: 
	Takes a nM8.0 stream file, and writes out another stream file
	which has the message time stamps adjusted so they are
	increasing (or at least non-decreasing)

streamPrint:
	Takes a microscape stream, from version 7.x or 8, maybe even
	previous versions, and prints all information about the
	message, including it's contents.

vrpn_newStreamPrint: 
	This app is generated using awk scripts from the file
	vrpnsp.c. It is designed to print messages from a new stream
	file format for nM9.0, which hasn't been implemented yet. The
	new communication format is documented on the nano manual web
	page. We propose the extension .nmlog for these streams. 
	(NOTE: currently does not compile, awk seems to be
	mis-behaving - 10/27/99)

streamToNewVrpn
	Conversion program from the old microscape stream files to the
	new proposed format. Hack:
	To run streamToNewVrpn, first start up vrpn/server_src/`hw_os`/vrpn_server
	streamToNewVrpn <old stream file>.stream <new stream file>.nmlog
	(NOTE: currently does not compile, awk seems to be
	mis-behaving - 10/27/99)

print_resist:
	This is a tcl/tk script which takes the output of streamPrint
	and creates two new output files in easy-to-graph format. They
	contain the OHM_RESISTANCE message and the
	SPM_WINDOW_LINE_DATA message contents, along with the message
	timestamps. Scott Paulson needed this as a temporary fix at
	one point. Could be useful as a model for extracting useful
	information from the newer stream print programs.
