/******************************************************************************
				slope_filter.c
Reads a block of X by Y floats into an array.  The code computes the slope at
each element of the block.  This is accomplished by subtracting the element to
the left of a given element from the one on the right of the same element.
This value is then squared.  Then the element above the given element is
subtracted from the one below the given element.  Then this value is squared.
Finally, the two squared values are added together.  This is done for the
entire block of floats.  On the edges, the slope is computed using 3 neighbors,
and in the corners it is computed with only 2. 

The parameters are nx, ny (number of samples in x and y, respectively).
The code exits with no output and status -1 if it can't read all of its input.
It also exits with -1 if it can't write all of its output.
If everything works, it exits with code 0.
