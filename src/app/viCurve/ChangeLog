	* Makefile (USES_LIBS): uses nmMP

	* GPIBKeithley2400.C: formatting clean-up.
	(tcl_default_dir) changed value to "./"
	(main) uses NM_TCL_DIR then NANO_ROOT/share/tcl then 
	tcl_default_dir to find keithley2400.tcl.
	(main) exits if no device or file specified, rather than 
	defaulting to argon-cs.
