	* eroder.dsw,.dsp : adding new workspace and project for an AFM
	eroder which erodes away an AFM scan in places where the AFM tip
	had to have been to perform the scan.  the eroder can either
	perform the erosion on a scan saved in a .er file by the AFM 
	simulator, or can connect up to the nanomanipulator and
	erode the current height plane.  in the latter case, data from
	the height plane, the afm scan, is sent across a vrpn connection
	to the eroder which then erodes the scan, displays the eroded
	scan, and sends the height values of the eroded scan back to
	nano.  In nano, the eroded scan can be viewed in the height
	plane whose name is specified by the user when the erosion
	was requested (from the Calculated Planes menu).  

	* erode.cpp,.h : new file which performs the erosion process,
	also can load and save files in format that is readable for 
	erosion

	* main.cpp,.h : new file with keyboard commands specific to
	eroder, as well as various event handling, adapted from the
	AFM simulator's sim.cpp,.h in ../3d-afmsim

	* ConeSphere.cpp,.h draw.cpp,.h input.cpp,.h Tips.cpp,.h
	Unca.cpp,.h uncert.cpp,.h Uncertw.cpp,.h Vec3d.cpp,.h :
	all are unchanged at present from those files used by the AFM
	simulator in ../3d-afmsim but are recopied here so that changes
	can be made without affecting the simulator.  this could be
	altered later
