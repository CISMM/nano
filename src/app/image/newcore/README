This version of coreview reads files using usr/Image.  It cannot read
topo files natively.  To retrieve the earlier version of coreview
(core) that does read topo files, use

cvs checkout -r native-topo-reader.

The code to actually track the core is found in

core_stimulate_at_point.C.  

This is a modified version of

./CIMAGE/src/core/ops/core_stimulate_at_point.c

The local ./core_stimulate_at_point.C has useful but relatively small
modifications, affecting the way the cores are stored and output.  The
code to actually track the code doesn't differ from that in the
original CIMAGE version.

The older version in the CIMAGE subdirectory is the "official" 
CIMAGE version and also contains a fairly large number of comments
that were added as I tried to figure out how the code worked.  So it
is the file to look at if you want to understand the core tracking algorithm.
