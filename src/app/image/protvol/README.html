ProtVol is a simple program to estimate the volumes of proteins imaged
by a scanning probe microscope.  User information is located at

The program was written in Visual Studio using FLTK.  It should be
fairly easy to port to Unix or Cygnus; no substantive changes were
made to the BC files, except to rename them to fit Visual Studio's
convention.

The file fl_main_window.cpp was generated by the user interface design
tool Fluid using fl_main_window.fl.  Neither file should be edited by
hand.  Fluid is available on our Unix systems.  Stephen Aylward,
Andrew Thall, and Sean Ho are a few people who have done programming
in Unix with FLTK.  I've only used it on the PC.
