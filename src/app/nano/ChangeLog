	* microscape.c (main): moved gethostname call and corresponding
	neighboring code to be executed before the dataset is initialized to
	ensure the correct hostname is assigned to d_hostname in nmb_Dataset.

2000-09-08  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscape.c (handle_openStreamFilename_change): took out
	delete of microscope connection 
	(the problem was in not unregistering vrpn handlers with
	references to the old microscope)

        * microscape.c (handle_openStreamFilename_change) : added delete
	of microscope connection before getting a new one - this somehow
	fixes a crash on the pc when opening the same file more than once
        * microscopeHandlers.C (handle_z_scale_change): this now updates
        nmb_Decoration so it can scale the modify markers to match the plane
        * interaction.c (handle_commit_cancel): allows cancelling of 
        planned line modification in USER_GRAB_MODE, USER_SCALE_UP_MODE,
        USER_SCALE_DOWN_MODE, USER_LIGHT_MODE, and USER_MEASURE_MODE since
        I think it would make things more convenient and I don't see any harm
        in it (an alternative could be to disable the cancel button if
        you aren't in touch before modify or select mode)

2000-09-04  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscopeHandlers.C (handle_doRelaxComp_change): Changed to make
	this consistent with how things are done in nmm_MicroscopeRemote.C

2000-09-01  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscape.c (main) : added check of 
	microscope_connection->doing_okay() to fix problem of trying to open
	an invalid file on the command line

2000-08-31  Kwan Torrich Skinner  <skinner@cs.unc.edu>

        * all : merged merge-2000-summer-thirdtech code with trunk.

2000-08-30  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

        * Makefile: took out RhinoIO for VC compile
        * microscape.c (MicroscapeInitializationState constructor): adds
        initialization for NIC_IP and logTimestamp
        * microscape.[ch], minit.c: fixed confusion over name of 
        function get_Plane_Extents changing to get_Plane_Centers

2000-08-27  Kwan Torrich Skinner  <skinner@cs.unc.edu>

        * microscape.c : converted procProgNames from nmb_ListOfStrings to 
	Tclvar_list_of_strings.

2000-08-17  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

        * microscape.c (handle_texture_dataset_change): sets slider limits
		a little differently (using minNonZeroValue instead of minValue)

2000-08-16  Tom Hudson  <hudson@cs.unc.edu>

        * microscape.c (main):  added call to
        microscope->EnableUpdatableQueue(VRPN_TRUE).
        * interaction.c (drawLine):  new function.  Added calls to
        microscope->EnableUpdatableQueue().
        (drawLineStep):  same.
        (handle_commit_change):  factored out large case and loop into
        drawLine() and drawLineStep().

2000-08-15  Jeffrey Juliano  <juliano@cs.unc.edu>

	* Makefile.additional-targets: New file.
	* Makefile: Post-include Makefile.additional-targets.

2000-08-14  Jeffrey Juliano  <juliano@cs.unc.edu>
