2001-06-05  David Marshburn  <marshbur@cs.unc.edu>

	* CollaborationManager.C:  changes to accomodate new PlaneSync.
	* microscape.c:  changes to use new calculated plane types.

2001-06-01  Aron Helser  <helser@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscape.c (initialize_environment): Hostname initialization
	(handle_openStreamFilename_change): Stuff moved from one-time init
	to everytime. 
	(handle_openSPMDeviceName_change): same
	(main): Re-order initialization so simple, default microscope is
	created first, then tcl/tk is initialized, then complicated,
	error-prone microscope init happens - error dialogs can be
	displayed if needed. 

2001-05-31  Aron Helser  <helser@cs.unc.edu>

	* tcl_tk.c (init_Tk_control_panels): Tell tcl script what
	directory it lives directly, instead of with environment. 

	* minit.c (handle_magellan_button_change): Grab button has
	quasi-mode when held, turning on scale mode. 

	* microscape.c: move of inputPlaneNames to nmb_Dataset, several
	places.
	(frame_rate): new tclvar to show frame rate. Use "-perf" arg. 
	(ParseArgs): fixed logic bugs if too many files on cmd line

	* interaction.c (doScale): New use method. Click defines center of
	scale, in-out drag defines scale. 

	* Makefile (APP_SUFFIX): new define so app and tcl directory can
	have extension. Allows multiple versions to exist in same
	directory structure. 

2001-05-18  Jason Clark  <jclark@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscape.c (setup_region): Use new terminology for
	surface-regions.

2001-05-15  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscape.c (main): moved call of
	microscope->EnableUpdatableQueue() to nmm_MicroscopeRemote.Cdef so
	that this gets called at a more appropriate place (when
	connection is actually made to the microscope)

2001-05-12  Aron Helser  <helser@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscape.c (handle_local_viewer_change): Send command to
	graphics to choose infinite/local viewer.
	(local_viewer) : new TclNet_int.
	(set_stream_time): Should be int until we handle correctly in
	callback.

	VIEWER changed to NO_MSCOPE_CONNECTION or NO_PHANTOM

	(handle_exportPlaneName_change): Set exportFileType correctly.
	(initialize_environment): Calculate Surface view window size from
	screen size
	
	* minit.c: comment out magellanPuckAnalog, since it's not
	used. Might be useful in the future.
	VIEWER changed to NO_MSCOPE_CONNECTION or NO_PHANTOM

	* tcl_tk.C: VIEWER changed to NO_MSCOPE_CONNECTION or NO_PHANTOM
	
	* Makefile : Flags to selectively allow compilation without
	phantom or without microscope connections.

2001-05-12  Jason Clark  <jclark@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscape.c: Switch the example visualization methods over to
	the new surface-region approach.

	Minor modification to the visualization methods to demonstrate
	something.

2001-05-11  Aron Helser  <helser@cs.unc.edu>

	* interaction.c (doSelect): Allow grab and translate of center of
	region, dragging of edges.
	(doRegion): new user mode, specify rectangular, rotatable
	region. Useful for nmg_Visualization, region of interest. Doesn't
	do anything yet. 
	(dispatch_event): Incorporate new mode, USER_REGION_MODE. 
	(handle_commit_change): Select icon changes
	(handle_commit_cancel): Select icon reverts to whole scan region.
	
	* minit.c (handle_magellan_button_change): Add USER_REGION_MODE to
	button 6.
	(handle_magellan_puck_change): Allow surface movement in SELECT,
	REGION modes. 

2001-05-07  Jason Clark  <jclark@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscape.c: Put code back in that somehow got obliterated

2001-04-30  Tom Hudson  <hudsoncs.unc.edu>

	* CollaborationManager.C (fullyConnected) : PC insists on a
	return value.

2001-04-30  Tom Hudson  <hudsoncs.unc.edu>

	* CollaborationManager.C (fullyConnected) : Test to see if we're
	already connected so we don't display the "got connected" message
	and call subsequent handlers twice.  Hack, but should work as long
	as we're not supporting disconnection and reconnection or as long
	as that facility is PROPERLY implemented.

2001-04-30  Tom Hudson  <hudsoncs.unc.edu>

	* microscape.c (main) : Add call to requestMutex() to try to
	get Tcl displays correctly set.
	* minit.c (connect_Magellan) : Add new parameter to constructor
	of vrpn_Tracker_AnalogFly to avoid collaborative head-butting
	where one Magellan idle in "*" fly mode doesn't allow the other
	collaborator to use Magellan or Phantom to grab the surface at all.

2001-04-30  Jason Clark  <jclark@cs.unc.edu>

	* import.C: Moved header file info into here to be consistent with
	only putting info in the headers that need to be accessed by other
	libraries.

2001-04-24  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* CollaborationManager.C (setPeerName) : if you run both 
		collaborators on the same machine this would not
		work right because it used the machine name 
		to select which of the collaborators would be
		in charge of synchronization and with both machine names
		equal, no one got to be in charge. Now, if you do this, this
		checks to see if the machine names are equal and if they are
		it uses the server port number to decide who is in charge of
		synchronization

2001-04-24  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscape.c: added -peerbaseport argument to let you run two 
		collaborating copies of nano on the same machine (you might 
		want to do that for testing)
 	* index_mode.Ch (isInitialized): new function to check whether 
		index mode is active
	* microscopeHandlers.C (handle_z_dataset_change) : checks whether 
		index mode is active before telling it there is a new plane
	* interaction.c : uncomments some informative print statements for when
		collaboration mutex is restricting control of microscope

2001-04-17  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

        * microscape.c: changed usage of vrpn_get_connection_by_name so it
        is by default compatible with vrpn 6 and if VRPN_5 is #defined then
        it should be compatible with vrpn 5 

2001-04-17  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscape.c (shutdown_connections) : added delete of sem_connection
        made logFile manipulations (reset, set time...) mostly uniform among
        afm, ohmmeter, vicurve, and sem
        changed usage of vrpn_get_connection_by_name so it correctly sets
	the logging mode 

2001-04-17  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>
        
	* microscape.c (register_vrpn_callbacks) : added hard-coded 
	room from head tracker transform for workbench (Phillips 101 setup) only

2001-04-17  Tom Hudson  <hudson@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscape.c (handle_openSPMDeviceName_change) : turn off
        vrpn_System_TextPrinter error messages for
        microscopeRedundancyController.
	(main) : same.

2001-03-23  Jason Clark  <jclark@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscopeHandlers.C (handle_z_scale_change): Don't call
	causeGridRebuild, call causeGridRedraw.  I had changed it to that
	before, but I fixed the visualization code so that it is back to
	not being necessary anymore.  So go with the faster causeGridRedraw.

	* microscape.c (handle_viz_change): chooseVisualization doesn't
	automatically rebuild the grid, so do it manually.

	Bug fixes for colormap plane weirdness that visualization code had
	introduced and crashing when closing a file after a visualization
	has been applied to it.

2001-03-22  Jason Clark  <jclark@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscape.c: Changes to support dynamic loading of textures and
	switching between them (for visualizations)

	* import.C: Modifications to allow using a file-load style way of
	importing objects, instead of just typing in the path and
	filename.
	
	* import.C (handle_import_file_change): Fix to allow closing of
	imported files.

2001-03-14  Jason Clark  <jclark@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscape.c (CenterUbergraphics): New function to ensure that
	the local axis of imported objects is always centered around the
	center of the current height plane

2001-03-13  Jason Clark  <jclark@cs.unc.edu>

	* import.C: See below

	* import.h: Color selection is now a standard option

	* imported_obj.C: Made it compile with changes to MSIFileGenerator

	* microscape.c: New callback function for viz texture scaling.

2001-03-12  Jason Clark  <jclark@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscape.c: Includes and uses new import code

	* imported_obj.C: Modified to compile with changes to Ubergraphics

	* import.h: See below

	* import.C: New file for handling importing of objects.  Old
	import_tubes file was only for MSI files, this file is for any
	kind of file to be imported.  That's why it's a new file.

2001-03-09  Tom Hudson  <hudson@cs.unc.edu>

	* CollaborationManager.h (d_peerName, d_gotPeerServer,
        d_gotPeerRemote) : new data members.
	(handle_gotPeerServerConnection) : new function.
	(handle_gotPeerRemoteConnection) : same.

2001-02-09  Jason Clark  <jclark@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscopeHandlers.C: Changed handle_z_scale_change to call
	causeGridRebuild instead of causeGridRedraw

	* microscape.c: Added Tcl variables and callback functions to
	support	visualization interface

2001-02-01  Aron Helser  <helser@cs.unc.edu>

	* minit.c (handle_phantom_error): On any phantom error, release
	the phantom button.  

2001-01-19  Jason Clark  <jclark@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscape.c (handle_analyze_shape): Fixed analyze shape code to
	work by callback through TCL variable, the way I should have done
	it in the first place.

2001-01-14  Jason Clark  <jclark@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscape.c: Modified to use new Shape Analysis code and to
	use new "Visualization" code.

	* Makefile (USES_LIBS): Added new lib nmAnalyze

2001-01-14  Tom Hudson  <hudson@cs.unc.edu>

        * microscape.c (MicroscapeInitializationState) : add members
        logPhantom, phantomLogPath
        (MicroscapeInitializationState constructor) : initialize new members
        (ParseArgs) : read new command line argument -logphantom
        (Usage) : document -logphantom, fix a few line breaks
        (main) : handle logging Phantom

2000-01-08  Tom Hudson  <hudson@cs.unc.edu>

	* CollaborationManager.h:  add autodoc comments

	* microscape.c:  revise comments

2000-12-28  Aron Helser  <helser@cs.unc.edu>

	* globals.[Ch]: removed tcl_offsets for knobs, mode_change, and
	user_mode.  

	* interaction.[ch] (dispatch_event): Removed user parameter - always
	user 0. 
	(all): Changed to single head/hand tracker.
	Changed to user_0_mode. 

	* microscape.c (handleCharacterCommand): Obsolete, removed all
	commands accessible somewhere else.
	(handle_tcl_quit): new
	(handle_clear_markers_change): new 
	(all): Changed to single head/hand tracker.
	Changed to user_0_mode. 

	* microscopeHandlers.C (handle_z_dataset_change): removed
	handleCharacterCommand call, set user_0_mode instead
	(handle_z_scale_change): same

	* minit.c: Changed to user_0_mode, changed to single head/hand
	tracker. 

	* tcl_tk.[hc] (init_Tk_variables): Simplified user_mode to single
	tclvar_int, removed tcl knob handling. 
	(set_Tk_command_handler): removed.

2000-12-20  Aron Helser  <helser@cs.unc.edu>

	* all: 3rdtech merge into main trunk. 

2000-12-15  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscape.c (createNewMicroscope) : 
        added call to TipConv->changeDataset

2000-12-14  Tom Hudson  <hudson@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscape.c (shutdown_connections) : delete
        microscopeRedundancyController before deleting microscope_connection

	(handle_numRedundant_change) : same
	(handle_redundantInterval_change) : same
	(handle_useMonitor_change) : same
	(handle_monitorThreshold_change) : same
	(handle_monitorDecay_change) : same
	* microscape.c : add new Tclvars for network statistics
	(handle_recordAdaptations_change) : new function
	(handle_msTimestampsName_change) : same

2000-12-05  Kwan Torrich Skinner <skinner@cs.unc.edu>

	* interaction.c (handle_commit_change) : new code to handle optimize now mode.
	(handle_commit_cancel) : same.
	(dispatch_event) : same.
	(doLine) : same.

	* interaction.h : external reference to position_sphere(float, float, float)
	
2000-12-05  Russ Taylor  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscape.c (register_vrpn_phantom_callbacks) : Moved the
	Phantom to the correct location when using the new Workbench (head-
	tracked mono or stereo flat-screen CRT).

2000-11-30  Russ Taylor  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscape.c (find_center_xforms) : Modified the center code for
	the workbench case, so that it fills the whole screen and is tilted
	45 degrees away -- since we are now using horizontal flat-screen CRT.

2000-11-29  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscape.c (Usage) : add documentation of -daligner argument
        (main) : add printouts of what colorplane, colormap and heightplane
	were getting set to because there seems to be some problem with
	them getting set to what the user says they should be

2000-11-29  Tom Hudson  <hudson@cs.unc.edu>

	* minit.h : new file
	* interaction.c : #include minit.h
        (doSelect) : add test of microscope->haveMutex()
	* interaction.h : add #defines for knob box
	* microscape.c : move around #includes, #include minit.h
	(createNewMicroscope) : add call of microscope->requestMutex()
	* microscape.h : remove redundant, obsolete, or mis-placed items
	* microscapeHandlers.C : #include minit.h

	* tcl_tk.c : remove dead code

2000-11-20  Tom Hudson  <hudson@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscape.c : add vrpn_bool g_syncPending to reduce problems
	with rapidly changing between private and shared states

2000-11-20  Kwan Skinner  <skinner@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscape.c (teardownSynchronization) : new function.
	(createNewMicroscope) : do the right thing when a new streamfile is
	opened in collaboration.

2000-11-5  Tom Hudson  <hudson@cs.unc.edu>

	* mf.h : move file to attic
	* renderer.C : same

        * microscopeHandlers.h : same
        * minit.c : same
        * normal.c : same
        * x_util.c : same

2000-10-26  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscape.c : 
        disables microscopeRedundancyController by not creating it
	(just commented out the call to new so this pointer is always NULL now)
	this is just temporary for the release

2000-10-24  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* error_display.C : merge with changes in thirdtech_branch

2000-10-23  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* interaction.c (drawLine) : fixes to re-enable updatableQueue properly
	it still may not be disabled in all places that it should but it
	is better that it be overly enabled than overly disabled

2000-10-16  Tom Hudson  <hudson@cs.unc.edu>

	* interaction.c (updateMicroscopeRTTEstimate) : new function

2000-10-16  Tom Hudson  <hudson@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscape.c :  add colorplane, colormap, heightplane to istate
	(ParseArgs) : handle new arguments
	(Usage) : document new arguments
	(main) : use new arguments

2000-10-12  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

        * microscape.c (handle_openStreamFilename_change) : The log file was
	not getting reset if you reopened the same one. I thought this
	problem had been fixed before by making vrpn_get_connection_by_name 
        reset the log file if we tell it that we want to open a log file
	which is already open but perhaps this got changed back. Now we
	explicitly call reset() on the log file - this was discovered 
	because we weren't getting the grid size message and then we got
	a message with data in it that didn't match the grid size

2000-10-09  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscape.c (main) : added copy of file name out of the
        istate.afm.deviceName into the istate.afm.inputStreamName when
        the deviceName refers to a file - this was causing a bunch of stuff
	to be overwritten by a strcpy of the uninitialized 
        istate.afm.inputStreamName into a variable in AFMState

2000-10-05  Tom Hudson  <hudson@cs.unc.edu>

	* CollaborationManager.C (setPeerName) :  add diagnostics
	* collaboration.C :  delete entire file contents and replace with
        comment about intended unfufilled purpose of file
	* microscopeHandlers.C (cause_grid_redraw) :  delete dead code

2000-10-02  Kwan Torrich Skinner  <skinner@cs.unc.edu>
	
	* CollaborationManager.C (CollaborationManager::initialize) :
	Added two more collabVerbose statements for handServer binding.
	* microscape.c (createNewMicroscope) : changed 
	handCoordinateServer00 to handCoordinateServer0.

2000-10-02  Jason Clark  <jclark@cs.unc.edu>

	* minit.c: Added include <nmb_Debug.h> to get collabVerbose
	function.

2000-10-02  Tom Hudson  <hudson@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscape.c : add timeGraphics to initialization state
	(ParseArgs) : add handler for timeGraphics
        (Usage) : add documentation for timeGraphics
        (createGraphics) : check timeGraphics before creating a
        nmg_Graphics_Timer object, pass timeGraphics to RenderClient
        objects

2000-10-01  Jason Clark  <jclark@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscape.c: Added in Cloud Texturer server as an option

	* normal.c (Compute_Norm): New compute norm function

	* normal.h (Compute_Norm): Added new Compute_Norm function that
	takes floats instead of ints, so you can get the normal at an
	interpolated point

2000-09-28  Tom Hudson  <hudson@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscape.c (createNewMicroscope) : call doCallbacks() on measure
        lines after they're initialized to propagate those values into Tcl


2000-09-27  Tom Hudson  <hudson@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscape.c (shutdown_connections) : clean up after data_min
	and data_max to avoid segfault

2000-09-27  Tom Hudson  <hudson@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscape.c (setupSynchronization) : add long comment about
        the bugs we've had recently
	* tcl_tk.c (handle_surface_change) : remove dead code
	(init_Tk_control_panels) : same

2000-09-27  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscape.c (main) : moved call to init_Tk_control_panels to an
	earlier point so that interpreter exists when some Tclvars are
	initialized in nmb_Dataset - this didn't fix the bug I was tracking
	down but it seems to make Tclvar_list_of_strings::initializeTcl 
	happier (I don't see how else it could get the callback set up for
	changes from tcl although we don't expect such a change for most 
	if not all of these types of variables) and doesn't seem to break 
 	anything
	* tcl_tk.hc (init_Tk_control_panels) : split this into two functions
	called init_Tk_control_panels and init_Tk_variables - the second one
	probably contains some obsolete variables (this change was needed
	to allow the interpreter to be created earlier in the startup
	sequence)

2000-09-26  Tom Hudson  <hudson@cs.unc.edu>

	* CollaborationManager.C : include nmb_Debug.h
        (getPeer) : replace fprintf() with collabVerbose()

2000-09-21  Tom Hudson  <hudson@cs.unc.edu>

        * tcl_tk.c (init_Tk_control_panels) : take collaborationTimer as

        (createNewMicroscope) : call linkMicroscopeToInterface()
        (main) : same;  handle & display timings

        * CollaborationManager.C : d_timer, d_myId_svr,
        d_myId_rem, d_timerSN_type, d_timerSNreply_type : new data members

        * interaction.c : clean up old code & comments
        (FDOnOffMonitor) : new class
        (setupHaptics) : use objects on haptic_manager instead of
        local static objects;  handle feelahead.
        (doLine) : use FDOnOffMonitor
        (doFeelLive) : same
        (doFeelFromGrid) : same;  call setupHaptics()
        (setupSweepIcon) : new function
        (linkMicroscopeToInterface) : same
        (initializeInteraction) : create objects on haptic_manager

2000-09-14  Kwan Torrich Skinner <skinner@cs.unc.edu>

	* nM_coord_change.C (mainloop) : made a call to server_mainloop, killed
	a compiler warning.

2000-09-14  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscape.c : textureConversionMapName initialized to "none"
	instead of "CUSTOM"

2000-09-13  Kwan Torrich Skinner  <skinner@cs.unc.edu>
	* microscape.c (initialize_environment) : replaced instances of
	ccs0 with handCoordinateServer0 and instances of cmode0 with
	userModeServer0.
	* CollaborationManager.C (setPeerName) : same.

2000-09-12  Kwan Torrich Skinner  <skinner@cs.unc.edu>
	* microscape.c (main): moved gethostname call and corresponding
	neighboring code to be executed before the dataset is initialized to
	ensure the correct hostname is assigned to d_hostname in nmb_Dataset.

2000-09-08  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscape.c (handle_openStreamFilename_change): took out
	delete of microscope connection 
	(the problem was in not unregistering vrpn handlers with
	references to the old microscope)

2000-09-07  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>
        
        * microscape.c (handle_openStreamFilename_change) : added delete
	of microscope connection before getting a new one - this somehow
	fixes a crash on the pc when opening the same file more than once
        * microscopeHandlers.C (handle_z_scale_change): this now updates
        nmb_Decoration so it can scale the modify markers to match the plane
        * interaction.c (handle_commit_cancel): allows cancelling of 
        planned line modification in USER_GRAB_MODE, USER_SCALE_UP_MODE,
        USER_SCALE_DOWN_MODE, USER_LIGHT_MODE, and USER_MEASURE_MODE since
        I think it would make things more convenient and I don't see any harm
        in it (an alternative could be to disable the cancel button if
        you aren't in touch before modify or select mode)

2000-09-04  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscopeHandlers.C (handle_doRelaxComp_change): Changed to make
	this consistent with how things are done in nmm_MicroscopeRemote.C

2000-09-01  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* microscape.c (main) : added check of 
	microscope_connection->doing_okay() to fix problem of trying to open
	an invalid file on the command line

2000-08-31  Kwan Torrich Skinner  <skinner@cs.unc.edu>

        * all : merged merge-2000-summer-thirdtech code with trunk.

2000-08-30  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

        * Makefile: took out RhinoIO for VC compile
        * microscape.c (MicroscapeInitializationState constructor): adds
        initialization for NIC_IP and logTimestamp
        * microscape.[ch], minit.c: fixed confusion over name of 
        function get_Plane_Extents changing to get_Plane_Centers

2000-08-27  Kwan Torrich Skinner  <skinner@cs.unc.edu>

        * microscape.c : converted procProgNames from nmb_ListOfStrings to 
	Tclvar_list_of_strings.

2000-08-17  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

        * microscape.c (handle_texture_dataset_change): sets slider limits
		a little differently (using minNonZeroValue instead of minValue)

2000-08-16  Tom Hudson  <hudson@cs.unc.edu>

        * microscape.c (main):  added call to
        microscope->EnableUpdatableQueue(VRPN_TRUE).
        * interaction.c (drawLine):  new function.  Added calls to
        microscope->EnableUpdatableQueue().
        (drawLineStep):  same.
        (handle_commit_change):  factored out large case and loop into
        drawLine() and drawLineStep().

2000-08-15  Jeffrey Juliano  <juliano@cs.unc.edu>

	* Makefile.additional-targets: New file.
	* Makefile: Post-include Makefile.additional-targets.

2000-08-14  Jeffrey Juliano  <juliano@cs.unc.edu>
