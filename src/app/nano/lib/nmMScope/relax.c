/* Relaxation compensation routines.
** Basic idea:
**   1)Constants tmin and tsep set with relax_set_???() routines.
**     These initialize the how long to ignore data as microscope
**     stabalizes, how long to average data, and how much separation
**     between data points is necessary to get accurate model.
**     Averaging is only important if the microscope is in single
**     sample mode.
**   2)Type of compensation, initial time, and nominal (assumed correct)
**     Z value set with one of the init routines (bias_init, relax_init).
**   3)relax_comp() can be called any time.  It's return value is stored
**     in variable RelaxComp.  RelaxComp is 0 if no compensation is to
**     be performed (relax_comp() is not called), -1 if the compensation
**     is in the data acquisition phase (so output of relax_comp() should
**     be ignored, and 1 if the output of relax_comp() is compensated and
**     ready to be used.
**
**   The system cycles through the following states:
**     IDLE: Initialized and waiting for the microscope to stabalize.
**     WAIT: Has the first data point (may be average of several samples)
**       and waiting for time to take 2nd data point (1/t only).
**     READY: Has compensation equation and is actively compensating samples.
**
**   BIAS is zeroth order compensation (offset only).  RELAX works on
**   equation z' = z + Z0 - k/t.
**
**   Microscape currently only uses the RELAX capabilities.  Note that
**   ideally, RELAX performs same function as BIAS, with k computed to
**   be zero, but measurement error will introduce drift.  If the biases
**   introduced into the measurements are known to be constant, the BIAS
**   version will perform better and with less latency introduced.
**   RELAX automatically converts to BIAS when abs(k/t) gets less than
**   REAL_SMALL (1.0e-3).
**
**   All times in milliseconds, all length in nanometers.
