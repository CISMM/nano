	* nmm_RelaxComp.[hC] (updateMicroscope) : added this new function
	so we can send the relax setting message without having access to
	private functions in nmm_Microscope_Remote 
	(needed in microscopeHandlers.C)

2000-09-04  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* nmm_RelaxComp.C (enable, disable) : These no longer send messages
	to the microscope but do set the state of nmm_RelaxComp
	* nmm_RelaxComp.C (set_ignore_time_ms, set_separation_time_ms) :
	These no longer check to see if relaxation comp. is enabled before
	letting you set the values (they set the values no matter what now)
	* nmm_MicroscopeRemote.C (handle_GotMicroscopeControl) : 
	changed this so in deciding whether or not
  	to enable relaxation compensation, it looks at state.doRelaxComp instead
  	d_relax_comp.is_enabled()
	* nmm_MicroscopeRemote.C (RcvRelaxSet) :
	This now checks to see if setting was (0,0) to decide if relaxation
	has been turned on or off (this was the assumption before but 
	relaxation set messages were not being used for confirmation)

        * nmm_MicroscopeRemote.C (RcvWindowLineData): replaced cast of 
        d_dataset->heightPlaneName to char * with 
        d_dataset->heightPlaneName->string()

2000-08-16  Tom Hudson  <hudson@cs.unc.edu>

        * nmm_Microscope.h:  added data member d_EnableUpdatableQueue_type.
        (encode_EnableUpdatableQueue):  new function.
        (decode_EnableUpdatableQueue):  same.
        * nmm_Microscope.C (constructor):  set value of
        d_EnableUpdatableQueue_type.
        (encode_EnableUpdatableQueue):  new function.
        (decode_EnableUpdatableQueue):  same.
        * nmm_MicroscopeRemote.h (EnableUpdatableQueue):  new function.
        * nmm_MicroscopeRemote.C :  deleted some obsolete functions that had
        long been commented-out.
        (EnableUpdatableQueue):  new function.

2000-08-13  Jeffrey Juliano  <juliano@cs.unc.edu>
