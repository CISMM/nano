Package NMM:  nanoManipulator microscope

  This directory contains components that control a SPM.

nmm_Microscope:
  Abstract base class for SPM controllers.  Has code to marshall and
unmarshall VRPN messages (RPC), register message types, etc.

nmm_Globals:
  Extern variables and class declarations visible to any program that
links with this library.

nmm_Types:
  Enums and utilty structs visible to any program that links with this
library.

Microscope:
  A heavy-weight remote interface to SPM.

MicroscopeIO:
  Mid-level communications interface for Microscope class.  Buffers and
unbuffers messages.  Largely made obsolete by nmm_Microscope.

NetworkedMicroscopeChannel:
  Low-level communications interface for Microscope class.  Has buffer
and network connection handling logic.  Design is flawed.
Replaced by VRPN in nmm_Microscope.

AFMState:
  A structure containing state information and some utility classes
for the Microscope, specialized to AFMs.

drift:
  Code used to compensate for piezo drift.

relax:
  Code used to compensate for piezo relaxation.

splat:
  Code used for splatting sample points into a data plane.
