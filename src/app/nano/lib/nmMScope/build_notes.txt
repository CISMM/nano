i had to do the following to get the generated files built:

cvs checkout nano-cygwin-homedir-stuff
 follow the directions there for downloading and configuring cygwin

from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=99645,
downloaded perl-Parse-RecDescent.
unzipped the file and copied Parse\ from ...\usr\lib\perl5\site_perl\5.8.2\
to C:\cygwin\lib\perl5\site_perl\5.8
