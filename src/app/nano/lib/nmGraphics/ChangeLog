	* spm_gl.c (spm_render_mark) : In addition to drawing a line from
	Top to Bottom this now draws a line with a different color 
	which is the reflection about Bottom (the intersection tells you
	where the tip was and the size may be extended in both directions so
	that you can see where the intersection with the surface is even if
	you aren't looking at the surface for the same channel used to 
	set the height of the markers) (I think it looks better at least)

2000-09-01  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* nmg_GraphicsImpl.C (nmg_Graphics_Implementation),
	(causeGridRebuild) : removed checks of the g_VERTEX_ARRAY variable
	as was done in thirdtech_branch so that even when we don't use
	the vertex array extension, the arrays can still be used for
	storing calculated normals (I had broken this for the pc version in 
	my previous commit)

2000-08-31  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* nmg_GraphicsImpl.C (nmg_Graphics_Implementation) : put back in
	some checks of the g_VERTEX_ARRAY
	* nmg_GraphicsImpl.C (causeGridRebuild) : put back in some checks
	of the g_VERTEX_ARRAY
	* spm_gl.c (describe_gl_vertex) : fixed some stuff that got broken
	in the merge - in particular where the local variable Vertex was
	getting set (it wasn't getting set at all perhaps); now it is set
	both at the beginnning (so all the opacity mapping stuff works) and
	at the end where it gets copied into the vertex array

        * all : merged merge-2000-summer-thirdtech code with trunk.

2000-08-30  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

        * Makefile: excludes export_scene.C for VC compile

2000-08-27  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* chartjunk.c (scale_display): Changed snprintf back to 
	sprintf to fix compile error on pc (its not as safe but its still
	much better than before)

2000-08-24  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* chartjunk.c (scale_display): changed to dynamically allocate 
	the buffer for the message displayed on the screen 
	containing the file name so that really long file names
	don't get cut off. Also, changed sprintf to snprintf so
	we don't print past the end of the buffer just in case.

2000-08-17  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* nmg_GraphicsImpl.C (createRealignTextures): changed to look at
	minNonZeroValue instead of minValue

2000-08-14  Jeffrey Juliano  <juliano@cs.unc.edu>

	* export_scene.C (get_view_xform): Read unit system from template.
	(export_scene_to_openNURBS): Perform error-checking on args.
	Write unit system to .3dm file.  Put mesh on a layer.

2000-08-11  Kwan Torrich Skinner  <skinner@cs.unc.edu>

	* all: Merge thirdtech_branch code to trunk.

2000-08-11  Jeffrey Juliano  <juliano@cs.unc.edu>

	* export_scene.C (build_mesh): Fix scaling.
	(compute_view_xform): Factor scale out of rot matrix before
	convering to quat, then handle scale separately.  Handle both grid
	scale factor and model scale factor.  May not do the right thing
	with real datasets, but works with ppm file datasets.

2000-08-11  Jeffrey Juliano  <juliano@cs.unc.edu>

	* export_scene.C (compute_view_xform): Debug messages proving that
	quat lib doesn't do what I thought it was advertising.

2000-08-11  Jeffrey Juliano  <juliano@cs.unc.edu>

	* export_scene.C (build_mesh): Add xform to arg list.  Use xform.
	(build_viewport_from_nano): Remove incorrect q_normalize.
	(compute_view_xform, get_view_xform, export_scene_to_openNURBS):
	Incorporate scale.

2000-08-11  Jeffrey Juliano  <juliano@cs.unc.edu>

	* export_scene.C (get_corners_from_file, compute_view_xform):
	New functions.
	(get_view_xform): Change parameter list. Move a lot of stuff to
	the new functions.
	(export_scene_to_openNURBS): Adjust arguments to get_view_xform.

2000-08-10  Jeffrey Juliano  <juliano@cs.unc.edu>

	* ChangeLog: New file.
	
	* export_scene.C (QuadCorners): New class.
	(write_q_vec): New function.
	(operator <<): Same.
	(rhinoException_to_string): Same.
	(set_quad_corner): Same.
	(get_view_xform): Same.
	(export_scene_to_openNURBS): Add error checking. Call get_view_xform.

2000-08-07  Jeffrey Juliano  <juliano@cs.unc.edu>

	* nmg_GraphicsImpl.C (makeAndInstallRulerImage): Allocate correct
	size array.  `texture-size' is the length of a *side*, not the
	number of array cells.

2000-08-06  Jeffrey Juliano  <juliano@cs.unc.edu>

	* spm_gl.c: Tell emacs to use c++-mode.
	* nmg_GraphicsImpl.C (makeAndInstallRulerImage): Move deine of
	macro `texel' out of funct body, and undef texel after funct body.
	* graphics_globals.c: Tell emacs to use c++-mode.
	* graphics.h (buildAllTextures, makeAndInstallRulerImage): Remove
	delcarations for undefined functions. (They were previously moved
	to nmg_GraphicsImpl.)
	* graphics.c: Change "#define min" to "#define NMG_MIN".
	Change "#define max" to "#define NMG_MAX".
	Remove unused preprocessor macros.
	Adjust (fix) comments.
	Remove macro `vec_cmp' because unused.
	Tell emacs to use c++-mode.
	(createPyramid, makeTexture): Make static (internal linkage).

2000-08-03  Jeffrey Juliano  <juliano@cs.unc.edu>

	* nmg_GraphicsImpl.C (nmg_Graphics_Implementation): clean up

2000-08-02  Jeffrey Juliano  <juliano@evans.cs.unc.edu>

	* nmg_GraphicsImpl.C (makeAndInstallRulerImage): dynamically
	allocate texture array (was hardcoded to 512x512 cells).
	Handle float pt. rounding issues in texture size computation.

2000-08-01  Jeffrey Juliano  <juliano@evans.cs.unc.edu>

	* spm_gl.c (describe_gl_vertex): small speed/clarity optimization.
	Dereference pointer once, cache result in a reference.

	* graphics.h: include just quat.h instead of all of v.h
