Package NMG:  nanoManipulator graphics

The nmg package handles all graphics for the nanoManipulator.
No function outside this library should, or should need to,
have any specific graphics code (vrml.C is a resasonable exception).
Nobody else is guaranteed to have a valid graphics context.  An
instantiation of nmg_Graphics may be a local implementation running GL,
or a stub communicating via shared memory to a coprocess, or an image-
based renderer receiving data from PixelFlow, or ...

There should be NO user interface code in this directory!  That means
no Tclvars;  declare the Tclvars outside and pass them in through
member functions on nmg_Graphics*.  This may be awkward, but is what
we need for the distributed nanoManipulator.

nmg_Graphics:
  An abstract base class for microscape's graphics.  A checklist
for extending nmg_Graphics is at the end of this file.

nmg_Graphics_Implementation:
  The standard implementation of nmg_Graphics.
It uses Open GL and has all of the PixelFlow code included.
It is built on top of the old graphics modules from microscape.

nmg_Graphics_Null:
  A "null" implementation of nmg_Graphics that calls very few
graphics routines.  Meant for timing tests.

nmg_Graphics_Remote:
  A local stub implementation of nmg_Graphics that uses VRPN to
communicate with a remote nmg_Graphics_Implementation.

openGL:
  Implements the draw_objects() routine passed to vlib.
It updates stale display lists by calling routines in spm_gl.
It sets up material parameters and calls routines to render
the decorations on the surface.
On PixelFlow it also sets up the lighting.

graphics:
  Contains all the random routines culled from other parts of the
code when GL calls were isolated in this one directory.
It controls lighting and texturing.

spm_gl:
  Contains routines to build triangle stripped display lists for
the surface and to do other low-level rendering tasks.

globjects:
  Describes Open GL objects that are drawn in the world
other than the surface itself.
It includes routines to create and draw the icons for the hand,
the aiming lines, and text on the screen.

chartjunk:
  Has routines for drawing all the text that appears in screenspace.
For conceptual clarity it probably should also include the other
features that are toggled by the "chartjunk" button.
It is the only module in the nmg Graphics package that relies on the
nmm Microscope package.

pxflShader:
  declares constants and variables used to control the shaders
on PixelFlow.

graphics_globals:
  declares and defines all the global variables used by graphics.
It defines everything declared in pxflShader.
This is inconsistent.

font:
  standard library for writing on the screen.

nmg_Funclist:
  utility class that keeps track of functions to call during rendering.
One funclist is maintained in globjects for each coordinate space.




Depends on:  Tcl_Linkvar, BCGrid, BCPlane, Position, PPM, nmb (Base),
and nmm (Microscope).




To extend nmg_Graphics with a function foo (bar), you need to write
all the following (and provide implementations;  everything except
nmg_Graphics_Implementation::foo() should be obvious from the similar
functions, and nmg_Graphics_Implementation::foo() is where you actually
add your new function):

nmg_Graphics.h
  public:
    virtual void nmg_Graphics::foo (bar) = 0;
  protected:
    int d_foo_type;
    char * nmg_Graphics::encode_foo (int *, bar)
    int nmg_Graphics::decode_foo (const char *, bar *)

nmg_GraphicsRemote.h
  public:
    virtual void nmg_Graphics_Remote::foo (bar);

nmg_GraphicsImpl.h
  public:
    virtual void nmg_Graphics_Implementation::foo (bar);
  protected:
    static int handle_foo (void *, vrpn_HANDLERPARAM);

You will also need to modify the following:

    nmg_Graphics::nmg_Graphics (vrpn_Connection *, const char *)
      d_foo_type = c->register_message_type("nmg Graphics foo");

    nmg_Graphics_Implementation::nmg_Graphics_Implementation
      connection->register_handler(d_foo_type, handle_foo, this,
                                   vrpn_ANY_SENDER);
