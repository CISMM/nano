	* nmUGraphics.dsp:  builds with non-static run-time libraries.

2002-01-18  David Borland <borland@cs.unc.edu>

        * WaveFrontFileGenerator.C : Edited the file so that .obj file 
        loading is more robust.
        Also handles arbitrary geometry--not just triangles.

2001-12-18  David Marshburn  <marshbur@evans.cs.unc.edu>

	* TubeGenerator.C: remove compiler warning

2001-03-13  Jason Clark  <jclark@cs.unc.edu>

	* URender.h: New color setting function

	* MSIFileGenerator.C: See below

	* MSIFileGenerator.h: Removed color setting in this generator.
	Color setting is done in the containing URender object.

	* FileGenerator.h (class FileGenerator): Removed spurious const

2001-03-12  Jason Clark  <jclark@cs.unc.edu>

	* Xform.C: Bug fix and removed spurious print out

	* UTree.h: Bug fixes and filled in a few function stubs that were
	never coded.

	* UTree.C: See above

	* URPolygon.h: Bug fixes to original code and modified to work
	with new Generator classes.

	* URPolygon.C: See above

	* GeomGenerator.h: New classes that are used for loading the
	display list code into URPolygons.  Provides an abstract interface
	for any method to build these display lists.  For example, from
	.msi or .obj files, and for tubes build from tube analysis code.
	New classe are FileGenerator (special for any Generator that works
	by generating the display lists from a file),
	WaveFrontFileGenerator, MSIFileGenerator and TubeGenerator.

	* GeomGenerator.C: See above

2001-03-02  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

        * Makefile : added glut as external lib

2000-08-11  Kwan Torrich Skinner  <skinner@cs.unc.edu>
