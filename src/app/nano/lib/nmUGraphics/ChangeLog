        * ProjTextObjGenerator.C : removed an erroneous error message

	* FileGenerator.C : same

2002-06-06  David Borland <borland@cs.unc.edu>

        * ProjTextObjGenerator.C : new file for the creation of the object
	associated with the projective texture when in object coordiate
	generation mode.  The object is basically a cone with a "sight" on
	the end, and a center line through the middle.  Manipulating the
	object with the phantom/imported objects user interface causes the
	projective texture to be transformed accordingly.  The result is
	similar to moving a flashlight accross the scene.

	* ProjTextObjGenerator.h : new header file

	* FileGenerator.C : added ProjTextObjGenerator capability

	* SpiderGenerator.C : renamed a couple of functions for compatibility
	with the above changes

	* TubeFileGenerator.C : same

	* WaveFrontFileGenerator.C : same

2002-05-24  David Borland <borland@cs.unc.edu>

	transform to be locked for an object.

	* URTexture.h : same

	* URTexture.C : same
	
	* URPolygon.h : same

	* URPolygon.C : same

	* URAxis.h : same

	* URAxis.C : same

2002-05-23  David Borland <borland@cs.unc.edu>

        * URPolygon.C : fixed code for displaying projective textures at an
	angle onto objects correctly

	* URender.h : code for fine-tuning translations and rotations

2002-05-23  David Borland <borland@cs.unc.edu>

        * SpiderGenerator.C : code for individual manipulation of legs

        * URPolygon.C : preliminary changes for getting projective textures
        to show up correctly on objects when the texture is projected from an
        angle

        * URender.h : code for individual manipulation of spider legs

2002-05-20  David Borland <borland@cs.unc.edu>

        * URender.h : added variable and access functions for number of
        spider legs

        * SpiderGenerator.C : changed code to account for variable number
        of legs.  This allows the spider generator code to also be used for
        aligning simple paddles and determining curvature.

2002-05-20  David Borland <borland@cs.unc.edu>

        * URender.h : added variables and access functions for locking
        translations and rotations

2002-05-20  David Borland <borland@cs.unc.edu>
   
        * TubeFileGenerator.C : fixed a conflict between versions.

        * URPolygon.C : Previous change to object rotations was rotating
        around the wrong axes.  Fixed this.

2002-05-13  Andrea Hilchey <hilchey@cs.unc.edu>

	* URender.C,.h : eliminated SetRot*All (* is x y or z) for
	SetRotAll function
 
2002-05-13  Andrea Hilchey <hilchey@cs.unc.edu>

	* URPolygon.C,.h : eliminated SetRotxAll, SetRotyAll, and
	SetRotzAll functions for general SetRotAll function which
	takes in all rotation values from tcl menu boxes instead of
	just x, y, or z and resets all internal rotations from these
	values each time any one of them changes--elimintes problems
	with euler angle values returned from quaternions not matching 
	up with what is currently in tcl boxes, which was causing 
	objects to jitter


2002-05-09  Andrea Hilchey <hilchey@cs.unc.edu>

	* TubeFileGenerator.C : changed method of finding centerpoint of
	tube object from approximation using endpoints to averaging of
	all cylinder positions

2002-05-07  Andrea Hilchey <hilchey@cs.unc.edu>

        * URPolygon.C : changed parameters passed in to
	encode_and_sendRot function calls

2002-05-06  David Borland <borland@cs.unc.edu>

        * WaveFrontFileGenerator.C:  deleted a couple of lines by mistake 
        before last commit.  Fixed this.

        at the origin in nano

2002-04-15  David Borland <borland@cs.unc.edu>

        file is a .tfr, the correct info is sent to the AFM simulator

2002-04-11  David Borland <borland@cs.unc.edu>

        * TubeFileGenerator.C:  added code for skipping the first point in
        a tube, as the azimuth given is often not right.  added code for 
        automatically correctly orienting a tube with its corresponding static
        file.  previously only worked for files whose origin corresponded with
        the "world" origin (i.e. image files)

        mask.detail.txt

        * TubeFileGenerator.C:  made some changes for loading actual tube
        output files--not the sample file.  Changes are still underway

        * TubeFileGenerator.C:  added code to allow the user to select
        every nth point along the axis line when loading a tube--should
