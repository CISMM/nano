	* correspondence.C (Correspondence): switched malloc to new
	* correspondence.C (init): switched malloc to new
	* correspondenceEditor.C (eventHandler): handles errors from getPoint
		better
	* correspondenceEditor.C (setImage): uses minNonZeroValue instead of
		minValue
	* nmr_Registration_Impl.C (nmr_Registration_Impl): adds some
		data member initialization that was missing
	* nmr_Registration_Impl.C (registerImages): adds stuff to handle
		fewer constraints and switches the transformation type
		accordingly in call to transformSolver
	* nmr_Registration_ImplUI.C (newScanline): creates a temporary
		image so we can do some contrast adjustment for 
		display purposes but doesn't do this yet
	* nmr_Registration_Interface.h : adds enum values to 
		nmr_TransformationType
	* transformSolve.C (transformSolver): cleaned up this function
		quite a bit, making it simpler and easier to use - some
		functionality was removed but I decided it wasn't going to
		be useful; made it easier to use the things that are in fact
		useful but weren't be used like the transformations with fewer
		parameters
	* transformSolve.h : removed a bunch of headers for old code from
		transformSolve.C and the enum xform_solution_t
