	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.h:  added a compiler pragma to prevent a 
	build warning

2002-01-04  David Marshburn  <marshbur@cs.unc.edu>

	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.[h,C]:  added dependsOnPlane functions

2001-12-28  Russell Taylor  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* cnt_ia.C : Opened fDet file, rather than fSum file twice --
	this caused close of unspecified file descriptor later.

2001-12-04  Andrea Hilchey  <hilchey@evans.cs.unc.edu>

	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.C : removed unnecessary function call
	from nmb_CalculatedPlane

2001-10-31  Yoni Fridman  <fridman@cs.unc.edu>

	* cnt_ia.C, cnt_ia.h, nma_ShapeAnalyze.C, nma_ShapeAnalyze.h:
	Undid changes of 2001-06-14 that show identified nanotubes in a
	separate plane.  Reverted to writing out identified tubes to a
	ppm image.

2001-10-16  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

        * ppm.hC - renamed to nma_ppm.hC to avoid link conflicts with a file
        that has the same name in nmBase

2001-09-25  David Marshburn  <marshbur@cs.unc.edu>

	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.h:  commented out the names of some function
	parameters to clean up the build.

2001-07-30  Aron Helser  <helser@cs.unc.edu>

	* cnt_ia.C (cnt_image_order): Compile warning fix. 

2001-07-17  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.hC: changed nma_ShapeAnalyzeCounter variable to
	be a static member of nma_ShapeAnalyze instead of a separate global 
	in the header file to get rid of a multiply defined symbols error

2001-06-25  Andrea Hilchey  <hilchey@cs.unc.edu>

	* cnt_ia.C:  fixed 2 minor errors with strcpy function, no
	overall functional changes

2001-06-25  Andrea Hilchey  <hilchey@cs.unc.edu>

	* cnt_ia.C:  changed method of filling in ListofNames[] 
	and ListofUnits[] in cnt_image_select so that used the 
	const char * Characters() function in BCString instead of nonconst
	function that had created (safer)
	
2001-06-25  Andrea Hilchey  <hilchey@cs.unc.edu>

	* cnt_ia.C:  added capability to cnt_image_select() so that 
	it prints out data for all BCPlanes in the inputGrid, not just 
	the plane associated with this (the current cnt_ia object).  
	right now, the maximum number of additional planes is
	set to 10, as grid->numPlanes() was not a compile-time constant, 
	but this number may need to be increased

	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.C:  added new parameters to call to 
	cnt_image_select to do above 
	
2001-06-14  Andrea Hilchey  <hilchey@cs.unc.edu>

	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.C:  took out setDataset() which was just a 
	temp. fix function anyways.  added parameter 'dataset' to 
	imageAnalyze().

	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.h:  took out above functions as well as 
	data member d_dataset, since the only time that value is needed 
	is in imageAnalyze

2001-06-14  Andrea Hilchey  <hilchey@cs.unc.edu>

	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.C:  initial creation of class nma_ShapeIdentified.  
		This class displays the nanotubes that have been identified 
		in the original plane in a separate height plane that can be 
		overlaid on the original plane.

	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.h:  creation of header file for nma_ShapeIdentified.

	* Makefile:  added vrpn to USES LIBS
