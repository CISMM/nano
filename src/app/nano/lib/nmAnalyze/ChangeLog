	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.C:  took out setDataset() which was just a temp. fix function
		anyways.  added parameter 'dataset' to imageAnalyze().

	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.h:  took out above functions as well as data member d_dataset, 
		since the only time that value is needed is in imageAnalyze

	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.C:  initial creation of class nma_ShapeIdentified.  
		This class displays the nanotubes that have been identified 
		in the original plane in a separate height plane that can be 
		overlaid on the original plane.

	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.h:  creation of header file for nma_ShapeIdentified.

	* Makefile:  added vrpn to USES LIBS
