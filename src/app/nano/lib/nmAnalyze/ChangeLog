2002-03-21  Aron Helser  <helser@cs.unc.edu>

	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.Ch: Handle replacement BCString ->
	string
	* nmAnalyze.dsp: Release config now builds.

2002-03-20  David Marshburn  <marshbur@cs.unc.edu>

	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.C: loop variable change

2002-03-19  David Marshburn  <marshbur@evans.cs.unc.edu>

	* cnt_ia.C (cnt_image_fit): added explicit casts to
	disambiguate instances of fabs.
	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.C (blut_data_up): loop variable change

2002-03-13  Aron Helser  <helser@cs.unc.edu>

	* cnt_ia.C: Change to standard iostream/STL headers. 
	* nmAnalyze.dsp: same

2002-02-25 Andrea Hilchey <hilchey@cs.unc.edu>

	* 3d_afm.dsp : deleted unnecessary .dat files and changed Debug
	configuration settings so that they match the Release settings,
	also changed linking with vrpn.lib so that looking in correct
	location

2002-02-25 Andrea Hilchey <hilchey@cs.unc.edu>

	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.Ch : reversed array in storage for display of 
	shape analysis results

	* cnt_ia.h : made cnat_image_x and cnt_image_y public so could
	use them in nma_ShapeAnalyze (gives dimensions of data array)


2002-02-18 Andrea Hilchey <hilchey@cs.unc.edu> David Borland <borland@cs.unc.edu>
	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.Ch : changed nma_ShapeIdentifiedPlane object
	shapePlane from being a local variable to data member of class
	(ptr) which fixed plane display for Shape Analysis option under
	Analysis menu heading (previously went out of scope before plane 
	could be viewed)

	* cnt_ia : changed output of text files mask.details.txt and
	mask.summary.txt to display more useful information, uncommented
	some commented out code (cnt_image_select and cnt_image_order)
	and fixed bugs within it; also able to add back in calls to
	these functions in nma_ShapeAnalyze to allow plane display


2002-02-11 Andrea Hilchey <hilchey@cs.unc.edu>

	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.hC : rewrote interpolation algorithm to correctly
	deal with uneven division of nano dimension/sim. dimension

2002-01-31 David Marshburn   <marshbur@cs.unc.edu>

	* nmAnalyze.dsp:  builds with non-static run-time libraries.


2002-01-18  Andrea Hilchey <hilchey@cs.unc.edu>

	* nma_ShapeAnalyze : changed format of data array so that low row numbers 
	correspond to the top of the plane and data is updated from the top down as well

2002-01-17  Andrea Hilchey <hilchey@cs.unc.edu>

	* nma_ShapeAnalyze : added some checks for which rownumber the UpdateDataArray
	is on, and allowed for the fact that the number of rows might not be the same
	as the number of columns

2002-01-15  Andrea Hilchey <hilchey@cs.unc.edu>
	
	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.C : updated Update_Data_Array function so now calls
	blur function if necessary. created blur_data_up function which expands
	the data line passed into it if the dimensions of the data coming in is
	less than the dimensions of the source plane. interpolates both between
	data points in the row and between rows.

2002-01-04  David Marshburn  <marshbur@cs.unc.edu>

	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.h:  added a compiler pragma to prevent a 
	build warning

2002-01-04  David Marshburn  <marshbur@cs.unc.edu>

	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.[h,C]:  added dependsOnPlane functions

2001-12-28  Russell Taylor  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* cnt_ia.C : Opened fDet file, rather than fSum file twice --
	this caused close of unspecified file descriptor later.

2001-12-04  Andrea Hilchey  <hilchey@evans.cs.unc.edu>

	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.C : removed unnecessary function call
	from nmb_CalculatedPlane

2001-10-31  Yoni Fridman  <fridman@cs.unc.edu>

	* cnt_ia.C, cnt_ia.h, nma_ShapeAnalyze.C, nma_ShapeAnalyze.h:
	Undid changes of 2001-06-14 that show identified nanotubes in a
	separate plane.  Reverted to writing out identified tubes to a
	ppm image.

2001-10-16  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

    * ppm.hC - renamed to nma_ppm.hC to avoid link conflicts with a file
    that has the same name in nmBase

2001-09-25  David Marshburn  <marshbur@cs.unc.edu>

	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.h:  commented out the names of some function
	parameters to clean up the build.

2001-07-30  Aron Helser  <helser@cs.unc.edu>

	* cnt_ia.C (cnt_image_order): Compile warning fix. 

2001-07-17  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.hC: changed nma_ShapeAnalyzeCounter variable to
	be a static member of nma_ShapeAnalyze instead of a separate global 
	in the header file to get rid of a multiply defined symbols error

2001-06-25  Andrea Hilchey  <hilchey@cs.unc.edu>

	* cnt_ia.C:  fixed 2 minor errors with strcpy function, no
	overall functional changes

2001-06-25  Andrea Hilchey  <hilchey@cs.unc.edu>

	* cnt_ia.C:  changed method of filling in ListofNames[] 
	and ListofUnits[] in cnt_image_select so that used the 
	const char * Characters() function in BCString instead of nonconst
	function that had created (safer)
	
2001-06-25  Andrea Hilchey  <hilchey@cs.unc.edu>

	* cnt_ia.C:  added capability to cnt_image_select() so that 
	it prints out data for all BCPlanes in the inputGrid, not just 
	the plane associated with this (the current cnt_ia object).  
	right now, the maximum number of additional planes is
	set to 10, as grid->numPlanes() was not a compile-time constant, 
	but this number may need to be increased

	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.C:  added new parameters to call to 
	cnt_image_select to do above 
	
2001-06-14  Andrea Hilchey  <hilchey@cs.unc.edu>

	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.C:  took out setDataset() which was just a 
	temp. fix function anyways.  added parameter 'dataset' to 
	imageAnalyze().

	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.h:  took out above functions as well as 
	data member d_dataset, since the only time that value is needed 
	is in imageAnalyze

2001-06-14  Andrea Hilchey  <hilchey@cs.unc.edu>

	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.C:  initial creation of class nma_ShapeIdentified.  
		This class displays the nanotubes that have been identified 
		in the original plane in a separate height plane that can be 
		overlaid on the original plane.

	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.h:  creation of header file for nma_ShapeIdentified.

	* Makefile:  added vrpn to USES LIBS
	

2001-01-14  Jason Clark  <jclark@cs.unc.edu>

	* ppm.h: Initial Creation

	* ppm.C: Initial Creation

	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.h: Initial Creation

	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.C: Initial Creation

	* cnt_ps.h: Initial Creation

	* cnt_ia.h: Initial Creation

	* cnt_ia.C: Initial Creation

	* cnt_filter.C: Initial Creation

	* Makefile (USES_LIBS): Initial Creation
