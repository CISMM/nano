	* cnt_ia.C:  changed method of filling in ListofNames[] and ListofUnits[] in cnt_image_select 
		so that used the const char * Characters() function in BCString instead of nonconst
		function that had created (safer)

	* cnt_ia.C:  added capability to cnt_image_select() so that it prints out data for 
		all BCPlanes in the inputGrid, not just the plane associated with this (the
		current cnt_ia object).  right now, the maximum number of additional planes is
		set to 10, as grid->numPlanes() was not a compile-time constant, but this number
		may need to be increased

	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.C:  added new parameters to call to cnt_image_select to do above

	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.C:  took out setDataset() which was just a temp. fix function
		anyways.  added parameter 'dataset' to imageAnalyze().

	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.h:  took out above functions as well as data member d_dataset, 
		since the only time that value is needed is in imageAnalyze

2001-06-14  Andrea Hilchey  <hilchey@cs.unc.edu>

	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.C:  initial creation of class nma_ShapeIdentified.  
		This class displays the nanotubes that have been identified 
		in the original plane in a separate height plane that can be 
		overlaid on the original plane.

	* nma_ShapeAnalyze.h:  creation of header file for nma_ShapeIdentified.

	* Makefile:  added vrpn to USES LIBS
