	* scan.cpp : fixed a memory leak (oops!)

	* sim.cpp : some reformatting

	* 3d_afm.dsp : fixed some settings so that simulator runs correctly
	(added include paths, libraries, etc.)

	* scan.cpp : added a zDistanceScaled array which scaled the height 
	array values so that the display in the simulator matches that in 
	nano when the data is sent across--no need to change z scale in nano

	* sim.cpp : now data is sent constantly
