	* scan.cpp : changed zDistance and zDistanceScaled so that inverse of zBuffer,
	zBuffer stores values s.t. low row numbers are at the bottom of the grid, while
	we want zDistance to store values s.t. low row numbers are at the top of the grid

	* scan.cpp : fixed a memory leak (oops!)

	* sim.cpp : some reformatting

	* 3d_afm.dsp : fixed some settings so that simulator runs correctly
	(added include paths, libraries, etc.)

	* scan.cpp : added a zDistanceScaled array which scaled the height 
	array values so that the display in the simulator matches that in 
	nano when the data is sent across--no need to change z scale in nano

	* sim.cpp : now data is sent constantly
