	* sim.cpp : added offset to vertices for triangle display

	* scan.cpp : some modification to zscale for object information
	sent from simulator to nano, further modification needed

2002-02-26 Andrea Hilchey <hilchey@cs.unc.edu>

	* 3d_afm.dsp : deleted .dat files (not needed) and changed Debug
	configuration settings so that they match the Release settings,
	also changed linking with vrpn.lib so that looking in correct
	location


2002-02-25 Andrea Hilchey <hilchey@cs.unc.edu>

	* sim.cpp : added code to check for triangles stored in list in
	nmm_SimulatedMicroscope object (SimMicroscopeServer), and draws 
	the triangles that are there

2002-01-18 Andrea Hilchey <hilchey@cs.unc.edu>

	* scan.cpp : changed zDistance and zDistanceScaled so that inverse of zBuffer,
	zBuffer stores values s.t. low row numbers are at the bottom of the grid, while
	we want zDistance to store values s.t. low row numbers are at the top of the grid

	* scan.cpp : fixed a memory leak (oops!)

	* sim.cpp : some reformatting

	* 3d_afm.dsp : fixed some settings so that simulator runs correctly
	(added include paths, libraries, etc.)

2002-01-15 Andrea Hilchey <hilchey@cs.unc.edu>

	* scan.cpp : added a zDistanceScaled array which scaled the height 
	array values so that the display in the simulator matches that in 
	nano when the data is sent across--no need to change z scale in nano

	* sim.cpp : now data is sent constantly
