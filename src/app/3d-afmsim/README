This is a 3D AFM simulator based on Warren Robinett's CNT simulator (robinett@cs.unc.edu)

Compiling
---------

	1.  Weird step ! Create a file called depend (could be empty)	
	2.  make clean
	3.  make dep
	4.  make

Running the program
-------------------

There are several command line argument options, but none are mandatory.  they are set up
so that, as long as you have the correct arguments for each parameter that you want to 
specify, you can put the parameters in any order.  The parameters that can be specified are
as follows:

	1.  units used
	2.  tip radius
	3.  type of file to open

1.  To specify what units you are using, type:
	-units <units>

	(remember to include the '-'!)
 	where <units> is a string such as "nanometers", or "nm".
	Note that if you do not enter anything, the default units of nanometers
	will be used.

2.  To specify what tip radius to use, type:
	-tip_radius <radius>
	
	where <radius> is a floating point value such as 7.5.  If you do not specify
	a tip radius, the default value of 5.0 will be used.

3.  To specify a file to be opened, use one of the following formats:
	-type -p
 	-type -d
	-type -t
	-type -s
	-type -dp

	In order, these are for opening a protein file, dna file, triangle file, 
	spheres file, and both a dna and protein file at the same time.  Note that you do
	not have to open a file in order to run the simulation; leaving out a file type
	specification opens the simulation without any objects.  Various keyboard commands
	can then be used to place objects where desired.

Explanation of the '-type' command usage
----------------------------------------

1. To simply run the simulator, type:

	./sim				if you are on an sgi
		or
	./3d_afm/Debug/3d_afm.exe	if you are working in cygwin, or have the 
					application on your pc

	Note that all future references to the application will use './sim' to lessen
	confusion, but in all cases, either of the two options listed could be used.

2. To get the AFM of a protein
	./sim -type -p <protein filename> <ratio>
	<ratio> is a number  = (Unit assumed in the file)/(1 nm) e.g 0.1 for Angstrom\n
	Example : ./sim -type -p lac.data 1

Read pdb/README on how to generate a '.data' file from a PDB file.
--See Protein file format below

3. To get AFM of a triangular model run
	./sim -type -t <filename> <scale>
	<scale> scales the values in the given input file
	Example :  ./sim -type -t teddy.obj 10	

4. To run DNA simulator
	./sim -type -d <dna-filename>
	Example :  ./sim -type -d dna.dat

--See DNA file format below

5.  To run DNA simulator and protein file
	./sim -type -dp <dna-filename> <protein-filename> <ratio>
	Example : ./sim -type -dp dna2.dat lac-smaller.dat 1

--Note that in order to run the dna simulator and the protein at the same time, 
the data for the protein cannot be too large.  For example, the size of the file 
lac.data is too large to refresh all the data in a reasonable amount of time, but
the file lac-smaller, which has been pared down, is okay.  Look at these files to 
gauge an appropriate size when preparing your data file.

--Note also that the protein as a whole will also be centered in the simulation

6.  To get the AFM of spheres where the position you specify is absolute
	./sim -type -s <sphere-filename> <ratio>
	Example :  ./sim -type -s testfile.dat 1

--See Sphere file format below


Again, for any of the above examples, tip radius and/or units can also be specified,
and the order in which the three parameters (the above two and file type) are specified
is arbitrary.  So, the last example, ./sim -type -s testfile.dat 1, could also be any 
of the following, if we also wanted to specify tip radius and units:

	./sim -units nm -tip_radius 10.0 -type -s testfile.dat 1
	./sim -units nm -type -s testfile.dat 1 -tip_radius 10.0
	./sim -tip_radius 10.0 -units nm -type -s testfile.dat 1
	./sim -tip_radius 10.0 -type -s testfile.dat 1 -units nm
	./sim -type -s testfile.dat 1 -units nm -tip_radius 10.0
	./sim -type -s testfile.dat 1 -tip_radius 10.0 -units nm


Format for the protein file
---------------------------

x_position y_position z_position
repeat for all spheres

Example

34.0 34.0 0.0
36.0 36.0 5.0

--The above file would create a protein consisting of 2 spheres with the 
default radius.


Format for the sphere file
--------------------------
x_position y_position z_position radius
repeat for all spheres

Example

34.0 34.0 0.0 2.0
67.0 74.0 5.0 5.0

--The above file would create two spheres.


Format for the dna file
-----------------------

	Number of segments in the DNA
	Length of DNA
	Position of site 1
	Position of site 2
	Tangent at site 1
	Tangent at site 2

Example (see file dna.dat)

	30
	160
	20 10 10
	110 40 50
	-100 100 0
	-50 -100 0



Information
-----------

. This code uses display lists. They are turned on by default. To turn them off, change 
the #define DISP_LIST in defns.h and recompile.

. For objects totally composed of spheres, use the type SPHERE instead of NTUBE. This 
enable a number of optimizations. However you cannot change the length of an object 
declared as a SPHERE.


Key and Mouse bindings
----------------------

. Left mouse click on an object selects it. The object's color turns red
. Left mouse when clicked and moved while the key remains pressed moves the object along 
XY plane.
. Right mouse click works on triangles. It is used to select a side of a triangle.

The following keys produce global changes (not object specific)
--------------------------------------------------------------

. 'q' - exit
. 'o' - draw objects. By default, objects are not drawn, only the AFM is.
. 'w' - write the AFM to a file.
	In uncertainty mode, it writes out the uncertainty map.
. 'n' - add a new nano tube
. 's' - add a sphere, you will get a prompt to enter a radius, which can be any
	reasonably-sized floating point number
. 'f' - find the volume of all objects drawn, the volume will be printed to the
	screen and will also be appended to the file sphere_output.txt
. 't' - add a new triangle
. 'p' - toggle the tip model, the default is the inverted ConeSphere tip model
. 'r', 'R' - change the tip radius
. 'a', 'A' - change the tip angle in case of inv ConeSphere tip.
. 'i' - toggles between "no scan" to "semi solid scan" to "solid scan".
. 'u' - to toggle to uncertainty mode

The following perform object specific actions
---------------------------------------------

. DELETE - deleted that object
. 'd', 'D' - change diam
. 'l', 'L' - change length
. '+', '-' - change z
. 'x', 'X' - rotate about X
. 'y', 'Y' - rotate about X
. 'z', 'Z' - rotate about X

The following will have effect only on nano tubes
-------------------------------------------------

. 'e', 'E' - change roll
. 'f', 'F' - change yaw
. 'g', 'g' - change pitch


Important Note :
----------------

We had said earlier, right click selects one side of a triangle. But since a side of a 
triangle is modelled as a nanotube, you can perform all the nanotube operations on that 
side.
