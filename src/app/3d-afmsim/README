This is the 3D AFM simulator code.

To run the simulator run

./sim

to get the AFM of a protein

./run -p filename unit [-w]

unit is a number  = (Unit assumed in the file)/(1 nm) e.g 0.1 for Angstrom\n
-w orients the protein at different XY rotations and outputs the AFMS to files.

Note : 

We first rotate along X and then Y. The rotation along Y is on the already X-rotated protein molecule.


Example : ./run -p lac.data 0.1

to get AFM of a triangular model run

./run -t filename scale

Example :

./run -t teddy.obj 10

scale scales the values in the given input file


Information

. This code uses display lists. They are turned on by default. To turn them off, change the #define DISP_LIST in defns.h and recompile.

. For objects totally composed of spheres, use the type SPHERE instead of NTUBE. This enable a number of optimizations. However you cannot change the length of an object declared as a SPHERE.


Key and Mouse bindings :

. Left mouse click on an object selects it. The object's color turns red
. Left mouse when clicked and moved while the key remains pressed moves the object along XY plane.
. Right mouse click works on triangles. It is used to select a side of a triangle.

The following keys produce global changes (not object specific)

. 'q' - exit
. 'o' - draw objects. By default, objects are not drawn, only the AFM is.
. 'w' - write the AFM to a file.
. 'n' - add a new nano tube
. 's' - add a sphere
. 't' - add a new triangle
. 'p' - toggle the tip model, the default is the inverted ConeSphere tip model
. 'r', 'R' - change the tip radius
. 'a', 'A' - change the tip angle in case of inv ConeSphere tip.
. 'i' - toggles between "no scan" to "semi solid scan" to "solid scan".

The following perform object specific actions.

. DELETE - deleted that object
. 'd', 'D' - change diam
. 'l', 'L' - change length
. '+', '-' - change z
. 'x', 'X' - rotate about X
. 'y', 'Y' - rotate about X
. 'z', 'Z' - rotate about X

The following will have effect only on nano tubes

. 'e', 'E' - change roll
. 'f', 'F' - change yaw
. 'g', 'g' - change pitch


Important Note :
----------------

We had said earlier, right click selects one side of a triangle. But since a side of a triangle is modelled as a nanotube, you can perform all the nanotube operations on that side.
