	* pseudoStream.Ch: new. This class and application read in a
	series of data files, with sequential numbers in their filenames,
	and outputs a stream file that pretends to "scan" through that
	data in succession. "pseudoStream -f dna.000 -o d.nms" will read
	dna.000, dna.001, etc and output the stream d.nms. 
	* pseudoStream.[dsp,dsw]: project files
	* Makefile: compile with cygwin and cl.
