	* OpticalServerInterface.cpp : Added version number.  Modified to
		use Tcl rather than GLUI for GUI.
	* OpticalServerInterface.h : Same.
	* nmm_Microscope_SEM_diaginc.cpp : Same.
	* opticalServer.cpp : Same.
	* opticalServerInterface.cpp
	* opticalServer.dsp : Same.
	
2003-11-22  David Marshburn  <marshbur@cs.unc.edu>
	
	* nmm_Microscope_SEM_diaginc.cpp:  only sends an image when one has
	been requested.  was accidentally sending every image captured.
	* OpticalServerInterface.cpp (OpticalServerInterface_myGlutIdle):
	sleeps for 100 msecs.
	
2003-11-22  David Marshburn  <marshbur@cs.unc.edu>

	* nmm_Microscope_SEM_diaginc.[h,cpp]:  setBinning/getBinning functions
	* nmm_Microscope_SEM_diaginc.cpp (setupCamera):  initialize binning
	and exposure on the camera.  also changes the virtual acquisition
	resolution to 1024 x 800.
	* other:  minor changes from debugging.
	
2003-11-07  David Marshburn  <marshbur@cs.unc.edu>

	* nmm_Microscope_SEM_diaginc.cpp (setupCamera):  asks the camera for
	an initial resolution, monochrome mode, 8 bits per pixel and no 
	auto-exposure.
	(nmm_Microscope_SEM_diaginc):  corrected the return value we test 
	against for the call to setupCamera.
	(setResolution):  corrected a test for resolution appropriateness
	(acquireImage):  copy the image from the camera buffer to a local one.
	* nmm_Microscope_SEM_diaginc.h:  changed the default resolution

	* all:  changes from before I got sick

2003-09-17  David Marshburn  <marshbur@cs.unc.edu>

	* nmm_Microscope_SEM_diaginc.*:  further development.  the resolutions
	available are limited as the SEM code of nano expects.

2003-09-14  David Marshburn  <marshbur@cs.unc.edu>

	* OpticalServerInterface.*:  new; beginnings of an interface
	* others:  continued development

2003-08-28  David Marshburn  <marshbur@cs.unc.edu>

	* initial version
