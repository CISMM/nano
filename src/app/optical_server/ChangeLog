	* nmm_Microscope_SEM_diaginc.h/cpp:  corrected a problem with
	auto-exposure; the camera is now correctly told not to do auto-
	exposure (the difference was bool vs. BOOL).
	(printSpotValues):  new.  queries the camera and prints the info.

	* opticalServer.cpp:  uses vrpn_Connection, not synchronized
	* nmm_Microscope_SEM_diaginc.h/cpp:  many changes
	- only changes things on the spot camera when the camera is
	in between frames.  this should stop the crashing and the
	flip-flopping of values.
	- notifies the interface more dutifully when requested
	settings fail
	- adds an exposure setting.
	* OpticalServerInterface.h/cpp:  adds controls for exposure.

2004-06-11  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* OpticalServerInterface.cpp : Turned to Unix format.
	* nmm_Microscope_SEM_diaging.cpp : same.
	* opticalServer.cpp : same.

2003-12-09  David Marshburn  <marshbur@cs.unc.edu>

	* nmm_Microscope_SEM_diaginc.h/cpp:  returns to 8 bit images.  12-bit
	image capture was way too slow.  also, clips the contrast at max.
	* opticalServer.cpp:  returns to having the camera class make up data.

2003-11-22  David Marshburn  <marshbur@cs.unc.edu>

	* OpticalServerInterface.h/cpp:  adds double buffering and controls
	for image "contrast".  checks to prevent callback loops between
	c and tcl code.
	* nmm_Microscope_SEM_diaginc.h/cpp:  adds contrast controls and
	changes camera to give 12 bit, 8 bits of which are displayed and
	sent to nano with the help of the contrast controls.  adds a
	setResolutionByIndex function.  changes getBinning to take no 
	arguement and just return the bin size.
	* opticalServer.cpp:  changes to match the above changes.

2003-11-22  David Marshburn  <marshbur@cs.unc.edu>

	* OpticalServerInterface.h: removed implementation of setBinning
	and setResolutionIndex
	* OpticalServerInterface.cpp:  implementation of setBinning and
	setResolutionIndex.  Also, only sleep 10 ms in the glut idle func.
	* opticalServer.cpp:  added some initialization
	* nmm_Microscope_SEM_diaginc.h:  comment change
	* nmm_Microscope_SEM_diaginc.cpp:  virtual acquisition will now change
	resolution and binning.  Also, fixed the interplay between binning
	and resolution when either are changed (e.g., camera resolution must
	double when doubling binning to maintain the same image size).
	
2003-11-22  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* OpticalServerInterface.cpp : Added version number.  Modified to
		use Tcl rather than GLUI for GUI.
	* OpticalServerInterface.h : Same.
	* nmm_Microscope_SEM_diaginc.cpp : Same.
	* opticalServer.cpp : Same.
	* opticalServerInterface.cpp
	* opticalServer.dsp : Same.
	
2003-11-22  David Marshburn  <marshbur@cs.unc.edu>
	
	* nmm_Microscope_SEM_diaginc.cpp:  only sends an image when one has
	been requested.  was accidentally sending every image captured.
	* OpticalServerInterface.cpp (OpticalServerInterface_myGlutIdle):
	sleeps for 100 msecs.
	
2003-11-22  David Marshburn  <marshbur@cs.unc.edu>

	* nmm_Microscope_SEM_diaginc.[h,cpp]:  setBinning/getBinning functions
	* nmm_Microscope_SEM_diaginc.cpp (setupCamera):  initialize binning
	and exposure on the camera.  also changes the virtual acquisition
	resolution to 1024 x 800.
	* other:  minor changes from debugging.
	
2003-11-07  David Marshburn  <marshbur@cs.unc.edu>

	* nmm_Microscope_SEM_diaginc.cpp (setupCamera):  asks the camera for
	an initial resolution, monochrome mode, 8 bits per pixel and no 
	auto-exposure.
	(nmm_Microscope_SEM_diaginc):  corrected the return value we test 
	against for the call to setupCamera.
	(setResolution):  corrected a test for resolution appropriateness
	(acquireImage):  copy the image from the camera buffer to a local one.
	* nmm_Microscope_SEM_diaginc.h:  changed the default resolution
	
2003-11-07  David Marshburn  <marshbur@cs.unc.edu>

	* all:  changes from before I got sick

2003-09-17  David Marshburn  <marshbur@cs.unc.edu>

	* nmm_Microscope_SEM_diaginc.*:  further development.  the resolutions
	available are limited as the SEM code of nano expects.

2003-09-14  David Marshburn  <marshbur@cs.unc.edu>

	* OpticalServerInterface.*:  new; beginnings of an interface
	* others:  continued development

2003-08-28  David Marshburn  <marshbur@cs.unc.edu>

	* initial version
