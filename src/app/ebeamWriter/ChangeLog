	* this version compiles with glut on sgi (this port was motivated 
	by the need to check for memory bugs)
	* Makefile - changed the order of libraries and added V_GLUT flag to
	get the program to compile on sgi
        * controlPanels.C (handle_openImageFileName_change): sets worldToImage
 	transformation to a reasonable default value when loading new images
	and reads them in using recently added functions 
        nmb_ImageGrid::openFile and nmb_ImageGrid::getNextImage
	* controlPanels.C : added new tool modes for setting dump points and 
	selecting/grabbing
	* controlPanels.C (handleSEMChange): fixed problem with creating a new
	image for sem data and adding its name to the list of image names 
     	before adding the image to the list of images (tcl callbacks got called
	at the wrong time)
	* main.C (init_Tk) : added stuff for Itcl and Itk static loading
	(needed for sgi but not for pc_win32)
	* patternEditor.C (addDumpPoint): new function
	 (updateDumpPoint): new function
	 (findNearestShapePoint): new function
	 (findNearestPoint): new function
	 (drawImage): uses opacity value now for alpha
	 (worldToMainWinPosition): new function
	 (mainWinNMToPixels): new function
	 (selectPoint): new function
	 (updateGrab): new function

	* this is the first version of the seegerizer program that contains
          all advertised main features in some form
          1) alignment of old data with live data
          2) control over SEM including image acquisition and pattern
             drawing (for 0-width polylines only)
          3) pattern design/editing (polylines with width, polygons)

         to do:
          exposure calculations for filled shapes
          use of the exposure settings in actual pattern writing
          crosshair cursor for drawing window
