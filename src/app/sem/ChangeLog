	This is the first version that works for point mode.
	* nmm_Microscope_SEM_EDAX.C : disabled a bunch of calls to the column
	and stage libraries because these don't work right until we get version
	3.3 of the libraries from EDAX
	added calls to SgSetScanParams, disabled for now until I can test them
	Added a critical call to SetSgScan(EDAX_SPOT_MODE)
	Added error printout for point commands that are out of range
	Added commented out call to SpMoveEx - this will be needed when we
	get the 3.3 version of the scan generator library that lets us use
	the full x and y resolution

	* edax_server.C : commented-out call to atexit()
	* nmm_Microscope_SEM_EDAX.[Ch] : added stuff to handle new message types
	SetPointDwellTime, SetBeamBlankEnable, GoToPoint, SetRetraceDelays,
	and SetDACParams
        (nmm_Microscope_SEM_EDAX) : added test of stage and column control
	libraries - these might be useful despite the inadequate Hitachi
	interface that constrains them
        (setHardwareConfiguration) : changed name to configureSharedSettings
	(configureScan) : changed name to configureForImageMode
	(configureForPointMode) : new function
	various changes to use utility functions in nmm_EDAX
	* sem_server.dsp : added library files for state and column control

2000-11-29  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* nmm_Microscope_SEM_EDAX.C : added automatic relinquishing of external
	control when not scanning - has problem at 64x50 resolution with
	detecting non-scanning condition too early (hence the clicking noise)
	- should be looking at a flag saying whether or not scanning has been
	turned off remotely but this is okay for now
	added stuff for sending 16-bit data when code expects to be reading
	16-bit data but this still gets filled with 8-bit pixels (need help
	from EDAX for this)
