	* edax_server.C : commented-out call to atexit()
	* nmm_Microscope_SEM_EDAX.[Ch] : added stuff to handle new message types
	SetPointDwellTime, SetBeamBlankEnable, GoToPoint, SetRetraceDelays,
	and SetDACParams
        (nmm_Microscope_SEM_EDAX) : added test of stage and column control
	libraries - these might be useful despite the inadequate Hitachi
	interface that constrains them
        (setHardwareConfiguration) : changed name to configureSharedSettings
	(configureScan) : changed name to configureForImageMode
	(configureForPointMode) : new function
	various changes to use utility functions in nmm_EDAX
	* sem_server.dsp : added library files for state and column control

	* nmm_Microscope_SEM_EDAX.C : added automatic relinquishing of external
	control when not scanning - has problem at 64x50 resolution with
	detecting non-scanning condition too early (hence the clicking noise)
	- should be looking at a flag saying whether or not scanning has been
	turned off remotely but this is okay for now
	added stuff for sending 16-bit data when code expects to be reading
	16-bit data but this still gets filled with 8-bit pixels (need help
	from EDAX for this)
