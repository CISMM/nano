	* nmm_Microscope_SEM_EDAX.C : added automatic relinquishing of external
	control when not scanning - has problem at 64x50 resolution with
	detecting non-scanning condition too early (hence the clicking noise)
	- should be looking at a flag saying whether or not scanning has been
	turned off remotely but this is okay for now
	added stuff for sending 16-bit data when code expects to be reading
	16-bit data but this still gets filled with 8-bit pixels (need help
	from EDAX for this)
