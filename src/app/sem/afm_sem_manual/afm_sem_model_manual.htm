<h1>Manual for model-based AFM-SEM alignment tool</h1>

<h2>Introduction: </h2>

<p>The tool for doing this is part of the NanoManipulator program.
The purpose of doing this is to enable manipulations of specimens
in the AFM/SEM which are too delicate to be scanned completely by
the AFM. Instead, we touch the surface at only three user-selected
points. This method makes use of the AFM tip as a landmark for
registering the coordinate systems of the AFM and SEM.</p>

<p>The procedure for calibration consists of the following steps:</p>

<ol type="1" start="1" style="margin-top:0in">
    <li>Start up the NanoManipulator program (nano) so that it
        connects to the Observer AFM and Hitachi SEM.</li>
    <li>Load a surface model in the form of an image where
        intensity represents the topography of the model.</li>
    <li>Set the scan regions for both the AFM and SEM</li>
    <li>Open the SEM control panel and acquire an image with the
        SEM</li>
    <li>Open the AFM/SEM calibration control panel and align the
        model image with the SEM image</li>
    <li>Put the AFM in modify mode using direct-Z for 3D control
        of the tip and create three on-surface landmarks and one
        off-surface landmark</li>
    <li>Generate the model geometry and solve for the alignment
        transformations</li>
</ol>

<p>In the rest of this document I will describe in more detail
what is involved in each of these steps.</p>

<h2>1. Starting up the program:</h2>

<p>Start up nano using the command-line options to specify the
AFM and SEM servers and the stream file name:</p>

<pre>nano -d AFM@servername -dsem SEM@servername:port -o streamFileName</pre>

<p><u>Warning: Do not use the GUI-based method for connecting to
the AFM and setting the stream file. It does not properly handle
connecting and saving data from the SEM and may even cause the
program to crash.</u></p>

<p>The stream file data will be stored in two separate files:</p>

<ol>
    <li>streamFileName.nms contains the AFM data</li>
    <li>streamFileName.nms.sem contains the SEM data</li>
</ol>

<p>To replay the stream files use the command line options in the
following form:</p>

<pre>nano -d file:streamFileName.nms -dsem file:streamFileName.nms.sem</pre>

<h2>2. Loading a surface model</h2>

<p>Go to the &#147;File&#148; menu and select &#147;Open Static
File...&#148;. Select an image representing your model of the
surface. Note that the scaling of image intensity with the height
of the surface does not need to be specified, this is one of the
parameters that will be determined by the calibration.</p>

<h2>3. Set up AFM and SEM scan regions</h2>

<p>Set up the AFM and SEM so that both scan regions cover the
region on the specimen where you will do the manipulation. The
scan regions must not change during the calibration procedure and
for as long as you wish to use the result of the calibration. </p>

<h2>4. Acquiring the first SEM image for alignment:</h2>

<p>After setting the scan regions for both instruments, move the
AFM tip so it obscures as little of the surface in the SEM image
as possible.</p>

<p>Next, go to the &#147;Tools&#148; menu and select &#147;SEM&#148;.
This will open up the SEM control panel along with a window that
displays the last acquired SEM image.</p>

<p><img src="images/sem_controls.jpg" width="232" height="510"></p>

<p>By default, the &#147;Acquire Continuously&#148; checkbox will
be checked. You may wish to disable this checkbox to collect just
a single image. Select a reasonable resolution such as 400x512 if
it is not already selected. Next, push the &#147;Acquire Image&#148;
button to collect the first image.</p>

<h2>5. Aligning the SEM and model images</h2>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2">Go to the &#147;Tools&#148; menu
and select &#147;AFM-SEM&#148;. This will open up the AFM-SEM
Model calibrator control panel.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2"><img
src="images/afm_sem_model_calibrator_controls.jpg" width="409"
height="876"></p>

<p>You will notice that there are three sections in this control
panel with a radio-button along the left side. These are labeled
&#147;model&lt;--&gt;SEM&#148;, &#147;AFM&lt;--&gt;SEM contact&#148;,
&#147;AFM&lt;--&gt;SEM free&#148;. Make sure the radio-button is
set for &#147;model&lt;--&gt;SEM&#148; as shown above. You should
see two additional windows labeled &#147;reference&#148; and
&#147;adjustable&#148;. Under the model menu select the image
representing the surface model. Under the SEM image menu select
the image that you just acquired with the SEM - it should be
named something like &#147;SEM_DATA08_400x512&#148;.</p>

<p>Left click on one of the images to place a feature point and
position it and its corresponding point in the other image so
they line up with corresponding features. Do this three times so
you get something that looks like this:</p>

<table border="0">
    <tr>
        <td><img src="images/model_w_fiducials.jpg" width="408"
        height="427"></td>
        <td><img src="images/sem_w_fiducials.jpg" width="408"
        height="427"></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>6. Generating contact landmarks with the AFM tip</h2>

<p>Click on the radio button for the &#147;AFM-SEM contact&#148;
section of the AFM-SEM-Model Calibrator control panel. You will
notice that the two windows for the model and SEM images will
disappear and a new &#147;adjustable&#148; window will appear
with a blue color. This window will be used to display the SEM
image of the AFM tip.</p>

<p>In this step, you will interactively position the tip at three
locations on the surface and one location off the surface. In
order to avoid scanning over fragile parts of the specimen and
breaking them, all positioning will be done using the &#147;Direct
Z&#148; mode which allows the tip to be moved in X,Y, and Z with
feedback turned off. In the Modify Parameters window, click on
the &#147;Full params&#148; button to expand the control panel.
Under the Control setting, select &#147;Direct Z&#148;. You may
see a message box popup at this point warning that the Z-piezo
signal must be used. Just click Okay to dismiss this message box.
</p>

<p>The basic idea is illustrated in the following figure. For
each placement of the tip, the program will acquire an SEM image
and a corresponding 3D AFM position. This information, in
combination with the alignment between the model image and SEM
image will be sufficient for calibration.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

height="486"></p>

<h3>6.1. Adding a contact point:</h3>

<p>Next, on the main NanoManipulator control panel switch into
Touch mode and hit the Commit button. To move the tip, position
the Phantom and press and hold the Phantom trigger button. Do not
release the button until you have positioned the tip so it is
just touching the surface with minimal change in the force signal
(watch the oscilloscope window as you move the tip to check for
changes in the force). As you are positioning the AFM tip, keep
in mind that when you release the Phantom button, the apex of the
tip must be visible in the SEM image. When you release the
Phantom button the program will automatically do two things. It
will store the current position of the AFM tip, and it will
trigger the SEM to acquire an image. The SEM image will appear in
the &#147;adjustable&#148; image window with a single feature
point already placed on the image. A simulated version of what
this should look like is shown below:</p>

<p><img src="images/sem_of_tip.jpg" width="408" height="427"></p>

<p>Left click on the feature point and drag it so that it is
collocated with the tip apex in the SEM image. Although you may
not know exactly which part of the tip is the apex, try to at
least pick a point on the tip that is easily identified. </p>

<p>Repeat step 6.1 two more times so there are three contact
points acquired in total. If you make a mistake in adding a point
for the &#147;AFM-SEM contact&#148; section you can select the
point in the pull-down menu and click on &#147;Delete Point&#148;
to undo it.</p>

<h3>6.2. Adding an off-surface point</h3>

<p>Repeat step 6.1 but instead of releasing the Phantom button
when the tip is touching the surface, lift the tip far above the
surface and release the button.</p>

<h2>7. Calculate the alignment parameters</h2>

<p>At this point we have sufficient data for calculating the
alignment parameters. This should be indicated at the top of the
control panel with the words &#147;Sufficient Data&#148; in green.
If it says &#147;Insufficient Data&#148; go back and figure out
which step you left out and make sure you have specified enough
landmark points. Press the button labeled &#147;Update Solution&#148;.
This will trigger the program to generate a geometric model from
the selected model image and solve for the transformations
between the model, AFM and SEM coordinate systems. It may take a
bit longer the first time you try pressing the button because of
the memory allocation required for the surface model.</p>

<h2>8. Adjust visualization parameters</h2>

<p>Next you probably want to see the result of the calibration
calculations. Turn on the tip visualization by opening the &#147;AFM
tip&#148; control panel from the &#147;Tools&#148; menu and
enabling the &#147;Display Geometry&#148; checkbox. This should
show the last tip position reported by the AFM.</p>

<p>To see the model surface in relation to the AFM tip, enable
the &#147;Draw Surface&#148; checkbox in the &#147;Display
Settings&#148; section of the &#147;AFM-SEM-Model Calibrator&#148;
control panel. This will give you an estimate for where the
surface is in relation to the AFM tip although no AFM image has
been acquired. So it doesn&#146;t interfere with viewing the
model or tip, you may want to make the &#147;AFM&#148; surface
normally displayed by the NanoManipulator invisible by setting
its opacity to 0 in &#147;Setup-&gt;Display Settings&#148;. You
should notice an arrow sticking out of the center of the model
surface. This arrow indicates the direction of projection for the
SEM (it points along the electron beam axis). </p>

<p>To project the SEM image used for step 5 onto the surface
enable the &#147;Draw Surface Texture&#148; checkbox at the
bottom of the AFM-SEM-Model control panel.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you may enable the &#147;Live SEM Texture&#148;
checkbox to project the last acquired SEM image onto the model
surface.</p>

<p>Turn on live SEM acquisition by enabling the &#147;Acquire
Continuously&#148; checkbox in the SEM control panel and clicking
the &#147;Acquire Image&#148; button.</p>

<p>You should be able to see the SEM image of the AFM tip
projected onto the surface in approximately the same location
where the tip model appears.</p>
