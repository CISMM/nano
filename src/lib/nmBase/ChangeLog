	* Point.C (Point_list::clear) : add check for non-NULL before
        deleting

2000-10-02  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

        * nmb_Image.C (nmb_ImageArray::boundX, boundY) : fixed these
	to return the right thing
	* BCPlane.C (general change) : changed indexing of _value to
	be row-major instead of column-major - this change should be
	completely transparent except to those who use the function
	flatValueArray() - I looked for any use of this function and
	didn't see any but I have added a call in nmb_Image.C - this change is 
	useful because it lets us dump the pixel data directly into
	texture memory 
	* BCPlane.C (writePPMFile) : changed this so it would map valid values
	to 1-255 and invalid values to 0 so that output is a little nicer
	when you don't have a full grid of data
        * nmb_Image.C (getValueInterpolatedNZ) : new function that is
	just like getValueInterpolated but will return 0 if any of the
	neigboring pixels that would come into the computation of the
	interplated value is 0 (in other parts of the program 
	we use this to tell us where there is no data)
	* nmb_Image.C (nmb_ImageGrid::minNonZeroValue) -  changed to use
	the corresponding function in BCPlane
	* nmb_Image.C (class nmb_Image8bit) - replaced this class with
	a template class nmb_ImageArray which also derives from nmb_Image
        * nmb_Image.C (nmb_ImageGrid::pixelData) - returns something now
	instead of just NULL by returning plane->flatValueArray()

	* nmb_Debug.C (collabVerbose): Added missing ;

2000-09-26  Tom Hudson  <hudson@cs.unc.edu>

	* nmb_Debug.C : add collab_verbosity, collabVerbose()

2000-09-21  Tom Hudson  <hudson@cs.unc.edu>

	* nmb_TimerList.h : new data members nmb_TimerList::d_startTime,
        nmb_Timestamp::wasPending
	* nmb_TimerList.C (isBlocked) : new function
        (start) : same
        (newTimestep) : fix accounting for blocked timers
        (unblock) : set wasPending
        (report) : use data from start(), wasPending
        (newTS) : clear wasPending

2000-09-14  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* nmb_Dataset.C (constructor) : initializes colorMapName to 
	"none" instead of "CUSTOM". This is in order to keep things
	consistent between tcl and C but I don't understand why when
	all the tcl files get sourced this doesn't fix itself since the
	tcl code executes after the nmb_Dataset is created. (was causing
	some problem when collaboration code went to copy stuff around since
	CUSTOM is not the name of a colormap file and the code in nmg_Graphics
	that checked for this may have been removed recently)

2000-09-08  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* nmb_Device.C (nmb_Device) : initialize vrpn_HANDLERPARAM passed 
	to gotConnection handlers but not used (avoids warnings)
	* nmb_SharedDevice.[hC] (unregister*) : adds several new functions
	to unregister device-level handlers to match the ones for registering
	handlers

2000-09-07  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

        * nmb_Decoration.C,h (setScrapeHeightScale) : new function
                             (getScrapeHeightScale) : new function
                             (setScrapeHeightOffset) : new function
                             (getScrapeHeightOffset) : new function
                             (traverseVisibleScrapes): made this so it uses
        scaling and size to affect stored scrape marks instead of using
        values from the past that have already been applied to the marker
        parameters (this affects where marker_height gets applied)
                             (addScrapeMark) : this now uses the surface_z
        to compute the maximum depth into the surface (image z values) for
        modification z values to be used later in determining how high to 
        make the markers

2000-08-31  Kwan Torrich Skinner  <skinner@cs.unc.edu>

        * all : merged merge-2000-summer-thirdtech code with trunk.

	* nmb_Image.C,h	(nmb_ImageX(nmb_Image *)) : new constructor
			(maxValidValue) : new function
			(minValidValue) : new function
			(maxNonZeroValue) : new function
			(minNonZeroValue) : new function

2000-08-11  Kwan Torrich Skinner  <skinner@cs.unc.edu>

	* all: Merge thirdtech_branch code to trunk.

2000-08-10  Jeffrey Juliano  <juliano@cs.unc.edu>

	* BCGrid.h (class BCGrid): Add comments to some members.

	* ChangeLog: New file.

2000-08-07  Jeffrey Juliano  <juliano@cs.unc.edu>

	* PPM.h: (constructor_worker): New function.

	* PPM.C (PPM): Initialize fields.
	Bug fix - move real work to constructor_worker, and call it.
	(constructor_worker): New function.  This code used to be in one
	of the two constructors.
