/** nmb_Device
    This is the base class for nmb_Device_Client and nmb_Device_Server.
    It defines the interface which is used to detect completion of 
    commands for any derived classes. This interface makes it possible to
    script a well-defined order of commands execution and data acquisition
    among multiple nmb_Device_Client-derived devices.

    Any device which can affect recorded data indirectly by executing commands
    or which produces recorded data would be an appropriate derived class from
    nmb_Device_Client/nmb_Device_Server.

    Some other ideas for things we want in a device base class:
        listing available acquisition channels
        getting the latest values for each available channel
        ability to register a callback to be called when new data arrives for
           each acquisition channel

    Added 2000:  manages a vrpn_RedundantTransmission in addition to the
      vrpn_Connection to handle forward error correction (FEC).

    8/15/2001 (AAS):
    Added mutex for client buffer so that messages can be
      enqueued and dequeued in different threads
      Why might that be useful?: We normally assume in our programs that each
      command received by the server is executed in the order it is received
      but with a server and client running in different threads within the
      same program and communicating through the same connection object
      it is a little more difficult to enforce this. An easy
      solution is to use this synchronized queue inside the client and then
      to call the client's sendBuffer() command inside the mainloop for the 
      server thread. In this case client messages will be dispatched
      immediately and executed when we use the connection's dispatch function
      so instead we can just buffer them inside the client thread and then
      deliver them inside the server thread.
      Then I moved the buffer code into the base class.
