Package NMB:  nanoManipulator base

  Everything in this directory has data or function that must be replicated
on both the main controller and the graphics server.

filter:
  The routines that execute a filter script on a data plane and add it
to the BCGrid.  Called from inside nmb_Dataset.

nmb_Dataset:
  Contains a (pointer to a) BCGrid with all known data from microscopes,
and a nmb_Subgrid used to record the portions of that grid that have
changed.
  Contains the names of all the BCPlanes in the BCGrid that are mapped
to specific visualization techniques or parameters.

nmb_Decoration:
  Contains most of the trivial pieces of data other than the dataset that
need to be known to the graphics code:  scrape and pulse marks, positions
of measure lines, current tip mode (image/feel/modify).
  Encapsulates the scrape and pulse marks.

nmb_Globals:
  Declares globally-visible pointers to an nmb_Dataset and an
nmb_Decoration.

nmb_PlaneSelection:
  Given the current named visualization planes & input grid extracts
pointers to those planes conveniently and aggomerates them to be passed
around the graphics routines.

nmb_Subgrid:
  Tracks the portion of a grid that has changed (since the last
rendering iteration, so that those display lists can be regenerated).

nmb_Types:
  Type definitions/declarations.

Depends on:  Tcl_Linkvar, BCGrid, BCPlane, BCDebug, and BCString.
