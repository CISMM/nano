	* nmImageViewer.C: replaced GL_BACK_LEFT with GL_BACK so this
	code works when stereo is enabled on the pc

2002-03-21  Aron Helser  <helser@cs.unc.edu>

	* nmImageViewer.dsp: Release config now builds.

2002-01-31 David Marshburn   <marshbur@cs.unc.edu>

	* nmImageViewer.dsp:  compiles with non-static run-time libraries now.

2001-12-18  David Marshburn  <marshbur@evans.cs.unc.edu>

	* imageViewer.C: remove compiler warnings, commented-out code

2001-10-23    <conrad@cs.unc.edu>

	* imageViewer.C: Changed #ifndef to _WIN32 from WIN32 so that it
	can compile with the VC++ makefiles

2001-09-01  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* imageViewer.C (setWindowPosition): new function to move a window

2001-08-20  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>
	
	* imageViewer.C (ImageWindow): added image coordinate rectangle
	to keep track of which part of the image was drawn in the window
	the last time an image was drawn into the window
	(drawImageAsPixels): fixes a bug in this function
	(toPixels): removed
	(toImage): removed
	(toPixelsNoZoom): renamed toPixels
	(toImageNoZoom): renamed toImage
	(toPixelsPnt): new function compatible with scaled/translated images
	(toImagePnt): "
	(toPixelsVec): "
	(toImageVec): "

2001-07-27  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* imageViewer.C (drawImageAsPixels): made this a bit cleaner, more
	correct and added a lot more comments

2001-07-26  Aron Helser  <helser@cs.unc.edu>

	* imageViewer.Ch (setColorMinMax): new
	(setColorMap): new
	(calcColorMap): utility. new. 
	(drawImage): changes to handle using a color map to draw images. 
	(drawImageAsTexture): same
	(drawImageAsPixels): same
	(clampToWindow): returns flag whether clamping occurred. 

2001-07-24  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* imageViewer.C (createWindow): set image buffer size to 0 to save
	space for users that don't need this; added glutPositionWindow()
	(showWindow): took out setting of window size variables - this
	should only happen when we get a reshape event

2001-07-23  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* imageViewer.C (drawImage): added an overloaded version of this
	function that is a more general version of the code used in the
	seegerizer program for drawing an image - this can easily be used to 
	make a zoomable image viewer that automatically switches between
        using projective textures and glDrawPixels()

2001-07-22  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	imageViewer.C (drawImage): flipped image in X
	(toImage): flipped X and Y
	(toPixels): flipped X and Y

2001-03-02  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* Makefile: added glut as an external lib

2000-10-11  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

        * imageViewer.hC (destroyWindow) : new function for destroying a
        window
        * imageViewer.hC (setWindowSize) : new function for setting window
        size
