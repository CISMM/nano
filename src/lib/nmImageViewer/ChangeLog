	* imageViewer.C (createWindow): set image buffer size to 0 to save
	space for users that don't need this
	(showWindow): took out setting of window size variables - this
	should only happen when we get a reshape event

2001-07-23  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	* imageViewer.C (drawImage): added an overloaded version of this
	function that is a more general version of the code used in the
	seegerizer program for drawing an image - this can easily be used to 
	make a zoomable image viewer that automatically switches between
        using projective textures and glDrawPixels()

2001-07-22  Adam Seeger  <seeger@cs.unc.edu>

	imageViewer.C (drawImage): flipped image in X
	(toImage): flipped X and Y
	(toPixels): flipped X and Y

	* Makefile: added glut as an external lib

        * imageViewer.hC (destroyWindow) : new function for destroying a
        window
        * imageViewer.hC (setWindowSize) : new function for setting window
        size
