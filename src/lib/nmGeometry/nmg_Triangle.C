// errorThreshold:
// This represents the amount of precision loss we will tolerate
// in computing ray-triangle intersections. A smaller number indicates lower
// tolerance of precision loss. If the estimated lower
// bound of the relative error goes above this number then we will 
// treat the situation as if there were catastropic cancellation which
// we expect to occur when a ray comes very very close to an edge 
// (or two edges if near a vertex). In this case we assume that the ray
// hits exactly any edge for which the error threshold is exceeded. This
// effectively makes edges look a little fat but since we are using
// double precision in the nmg_Plucker class I expect the effect is
// insignificant. If the threshold is set to 0.1 a ray may still fall through
// the cracks because we are dealing with only a lower bound on 
// relative error due to a one-time precision loss. Accumulated precision
// loss could make the actual relative error significantly higher. Putting
// the error threshold a bit lower causes us to classify more calculations
// as having insufficient precision and eliminates those rays that would
// fall through the cracks due to incorrect assumption of sufficient precision.
