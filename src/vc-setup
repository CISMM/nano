# First: the object directory for nano must be visible as the same
# directory by bash/cygwin and CL, a dos program. 
# 1. Source code and object directory must live on the same drive
# 2. Create obj directory 
# 3. mount directory in cygwin so root-relative path looks the
# same in DOS or cygwin.
# 4. set MY_NANO_OBJ_DIR to point there. 
# Ex. I created the directory e:/nsrc/obj as my object directory
# At a bash prompt, execute: mount -s -b E:\\nsrc /nsrc
# In my .nano_aliases file, add line: export MY_NANO_OBJ_DIR=/nsrc/obj

# Change these to match your setup
