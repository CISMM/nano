These instructions are also available on the NSRG wiki: http://gpsf-wiki.unc.edu/confluence/display/nano/Nano+Manipulator+Compilation

These instructions come from my experience compiling the NanoManipulator on May 4, 2009.

   1. Install a CVS client. I like to use Eclipse because it is easy and has nice features for comparing local changes to code in the repository. TortoiseCVS also works well.
   2. See/contact David Marshburn to make sure your UNC Computer Science account has permission to read and write to the NSRG CVS repository.
   3. Set up your CVS client to use the repository with the following configuration
          * Server: cvs.cs.unc.edu
          * Directory: /afs/cs.unc.edu/project/stm/src/CVS_repository
          * Protocol: extssh
          * Username and password: your computer science username and password
   4. Check out the following projects from the CVS repository
          * quat
          * vogl
          * vrpn
          * nano
          * video
   5. Install the NSRG build time. On Windows, navigate to "\\nsrg\nanodata\installers\NSRG runtime" and run the nsrg-buildtime_3_0_0.msi installer (or newer).
   6. Install Cygwin. Make sure to install Perl 5.10, which is not included by default (It is one of the options found in the Cygwin menu that is shown right before installation). Do NOT bother with Perl 5.8, which doesn't seem to work at all.
   7. GNU Make 3.81 for Cygwin is buggy. Replace it with the version posted at http://www.cmake.org/files/cygwin/make.exe (this should be saved in "C:\cygwin\bin\make.exe").
   8. Download perl-Parse-RecDescent-1.94-1.tar.bz2 to install the module Parser::RecDescent. Open a Cygwin shell, navigate to where you saved this file, and bunzip and untar it. Copy RecDescent.pm and RecDescent.pod from "usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.2" (relative to where you saved the bz2 file) to "C:/cygwin/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.10/i686-cygwin".
   9. Open a Cygwin shell and navigate to "nano/src/app/nano/lib/nmMScope" (nano the project; not the nano folder in Cygwin). Type

      /usr/bin/make generate

      If you type gmake, it may not be the one that you downloaded in step 7.. Specifically, if MATLAB is installed, the gmake   http://search.cpan.org/~dconway/Parse-RecDescent-1.94/by the shell will probably be the one installed with MATLAB.
  10. Compile
          * quat - quat\quatlib.sln - Project quatlib
          * vogl - vogl\vlib.sln - Project vlib
          * vrpn - vrpn\vrbin.sln - Projects vrpn_server and vrpn_phantom (vrpn_phantom gets built as a dependency of vrpn_server)
          * nano - nano\nano.sln - Project nano
  11. Optionally, you can set up a batch file in "nano/src" to set the environment variables and run the program

      set PATH=C:\NSRG\external\pc_win32\bin
      set TCL_LIBRARY=C:\NSRG\external\pc_win32\tcl\lib\tcl8.3
      ..\obj\pc_win32\debug\app\nano\nano.exe
